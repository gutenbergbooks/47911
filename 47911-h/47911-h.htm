<i>OR THE STUDY OF FINGER-PRINTS</i></p>



<hr class="r10" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION: EARLY HINTS AND RECENT PROGRESS</h3>


<p>Dactylography deals with what is of scientific interest
and practical value in regard to the lineations in the skin
on the fingers and toes, or rather on the hands and feet
of men, monkeys, and allied tribes, which lineations
form patterns of great variety and persistence. The
Greeks used the term δάκτυλος του̑ ποδός (<i>daktylos tou
podos</i>, finger of the foot) for a toe; and the toes are of
almost as much interest to the dactylographer as the
fingers, and present similar patterns for study.</p>

<p>In primitive times the savage hunter had to use all
his wits sharply in the examination of foot and toe marks,
whether of the game he pursued or the human foe he
guarded against, and he learned to deduce many a curious
lesson with Sherlock Holmes-like acuteness and precision.
The recency, the rate of motion, the length of stride, the
degree of fatigue, the number, and kinds and conditions
of men or beasts that had impressed their traces on the
soil, all could be read by him with ease and promptness.
Such imprints have been preserved in early Mexican
picture writings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">

<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Footprints in Ancient Mexican Remains.</span><br />
Inset: Threshold with Foot-Marks (also Mexican).</p></div>
</div>

<p>In a similar way the palæontologist strives to interpret
the impress made by organisms on primeval mud flats
or sandy shores æons ago. There are numbers, whole
species indeed, of extinct jelly fishes the existence of
which has never been known directly, but that there
once were such beings in the world has been confidently
deduced from the permanent impressions their soft and
perishable bodies have left in the fine texture of certain
rocks. The Chinese tell us that one of their sages first
learned to write and to teach the use of written characters
by observing the marks made by a bird’s claws.</p>

<p>When we approach the limits of written history we
begin to hear faint inarticulate murmurs of a time when
the lines on human fingers began to arrest notice and
interest. Thus we sometimes find in later neolithic
pottery, nail and finger marks, used to adorn the sun-dried
pots in common use. The Babylonians used their
finger nails as seal-marks on commercial tablets, and the
Chinese have occasionally done the same. Not many
years ago, as I myself have often witnessed, when sealing-wax
or wafers were used more than they are now, servant
girls were wont to impress their thumb-mark on the soft<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
wafer or wax. There are several characters in the
Chinese alphabet (of some 30,000 letters) which suggest
such a use of finger-marks as seals, but after many years’
enquiry, I have not yet seen any direct evidence of their
use for such a purpose<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></span> The term <i>Sho-seki</i> is used in
Japanese to denote foot-prints, and also the tracking of
anyone. I have not met any passage or expression in
which finger-prints are mentioned in Japanese works,
except in regard to fantastical images of footprints of
Buddha and the like. It is claimed, however, that
prisoners on conviction were required to adhibit their
mark as a seal of confession<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></span> There has been no
evidence adduced that either in China or Japan was
there ever a system of identification by that means,
although it is conceivable that the form of making a
sign-manual may have originated from some dim perception
of their value for identification.</p>

<p>In a similar way finger-marks were used, as I have been
informed, in India, even before the mutiny, and were
supposed to be used like the cross made by illiterate
people in this country. The numerals up to five seem
to have been obtained by marking off fingers. A dactylic
origin of <span class="font">V</span>  as an open hand, complete with outstretched
thumb, has been favoured. <span class="font">X</span>  (ten) might easily then
be obtained by placing two <span class="font">V</span> ’s apex to apex.</p>

<p>There are certain folds or creases in palms and soles,
which are formed very much as the creases in gloves or
boots are formed, and with those the dactylographer is<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
not much concerned. Such lines were supposed by
many to mark the fateful influence of stars on the destiny
of their owner, and are the basis of palmistry. Similar
lines are found in apes. There are general patterns of
lineations all over the palmar surface of the hands and
the plantar surface of the feet which are of some interest,
but the chief practical concern of most students in this
new field is with certain points where patterns run into
forms of great complexity, especially in the palmar
skin covering the last joint of each finger. It is not
common to find either in pots or pictures those patterns
printed clearly, but the creases dear to the palmister are
frequently enough shown.</p>

<p>In Mr. C. Ainsworth Mitchell’s <i>Science and the Criminal</i>,
published in 1911, a case is mentioned of a very early
finger-print, if the evidence has not been <span class="nowrap">fallacious:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the prehistoric flint-holes at Brandon, in
Suffolk, there was found some years ago a pick made
from the horn of an extinct elk. This had been used
by some flint-digger of the Stone Age to hew out of
the chalk the rough flints which were subsequently
made into scrapers and arrow-heads. Upon the dark
handle of this instrument were the finger-prints in
chalk of the workman, who, thousands of years ago,
flung it down for the last time.”</p></div>

<p>It is now in the British Museum. A foot-print also
has been found of very early date.</p>

<p>Such white marks on a dark ground are often very
clear, showing the detail of lineations well, and presuming,
as is natural, that the ordinary precautions
were taken to secure that they were not recent accidental
additions to the remains, such a record is highly

<p>It was apparently a common practice in ancient India
to adorn buildings with crude finger-marks made with
white or red sandal-wood. The red hand common on
door-posts and the like in Arabia does not usually show
any lineations, but in some few ancient and primitive
carvings and in sun-baked pot-work, patterns occur
which appear to me to have probably had finger-print
lineations as a <i>motif</i>. Professor Sollas, in writing of
Palæolithic Races in <i>Science Progress</i> (April, 1909)&mdash;a
subject of which he is a master&mdash;says: “Impressions
of the human hand are met with painted in red in
Altamira, but in other caves also in black, and sometimes
uncoloured on a coloured ground. These seem to be
older than any of the other markings.” Some cases are
stencilled, as with Australians to-day.</p>

<p>The same writer, in a foot-note, also states, in describing
caves and paintings of modern Bushmen: “Impressions
of the human hand are also met with on the
walls of these caves.”</p>

<p>A traveller, Mr. John Bradbury, who witnessed the
return of a war-party of the Aricara Indians, <span class="nowrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Many of them had the mark which indicates that
they had drank the blood of an enemy. This mark is
made by rubbing the hand all over with vermilion,
and by laying it on the mouth it leaves a complete
impression on the face, which is designed to resemble
and indicate a bloody hand.”&mdash;[<i>Travels in the Interior
of America</i> (1817).]</p></div>

<p>The ancient bloody hand of Ulster is well known, and
other examples occur which might be quoted.</p>

<p>Some “prehistoric pottery” was found last autumn
at Avebury, North Wilts, of which I have not seen full
particulars. In a press paragraph, however, it is stated<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
that its chief interest “centres in the fact that it is
ornamented on both faces&mdash;the impressions of twisted
grass (or cord) and finger-nails being clearly defined.”
It is temporarily classified as a type of pottery associated
with long barrows and neolithic pits.</p>

<p>My own attention was first directed to the patterns
in finger-prints, as they occurred impressed on sun-baked
pottery which I found in the numerous shell-heaps
dotted around the great Bay of Yedo. The subject
was quite unknown to me till then, in the seventies.
No pottery has yet been found which belongs to the early
stone stage of man’s culture. But with evidence of the
use of fire, and of the manufacture of polished stone
weapons, fragments of rude hand-moulded pottery&mdash;sun-baked
or fire-burned&mdash;begin to be associated.
Sometimes these are quite clearly seen to be moulded
with the aid of human fingers, the nails only making
a clear mark, but in other cases the finger furrows are
prominently indented in regular patterns, which cannot,
I think, be distinguished from those made by men of our
own race and time. In the formal Japanese ceremony
of social tea-drinking, or <i>Cha-no-yu</i>, pottery of this
Archaic kind, with finger patterns indented in the clay,
is highly esteemed. In an article on this kind of pottery
by Mr. Charles Holme, in <i>The Studio</i> (February, 1909),
one example is described thus: “It is modelled in a
brown clay entirely by hand, without the aid of a potter’s
wheel. The impressions of the fingers made in shaping
the bowl are carefully retained,” etc. Not till Celtic
times in Europe is there evidence of the use of the
potter’s wheel.</p>

<p>I am surprised to find how very little attention has<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
yet been given to finger imprints on early pottery. My
own opportunities for observation have in late years
been severely limited, but I have seldom had a peep at
ancient potsherds without discovering some few traces
of the kind of impressions, accidental or designed, which
I have described. I have not had early Teutonic pottery
specially under observation, but Professor G. Baldwin
Brown, who is an accomplished authority in that department,
wrote me <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the early Teutonic pottery, so far as I have
examined it, the ornamental patterns are produced
by drawing lines and furrows with some hard tool,
such as a shaped point of wood or bone. It is very
rarely that the furrows or circular depressions have the
soft edges which would suggest the use of the finger,
and I have never noticed the texture of the finger-tip
impressed on the clay, though I have not looked specially
for this with a glass. Ornaments are also commonly
impressed with a wooden stamp on which some
simple pattern has been cut. The only ornamental
motive which seems to spring directly out of manipulation
by the fingers is the projecting boss, characteristic
of a certain class of Teutonic ware. The clay
is forced out from within in the form of a knob or a
flute, and the idea of such an ornamental treatment
has probably arisen from the accidental projections
produced in the exterior surface of the vase by the
pressure of the fingers when the vase is being shaped
from within. There is nothing in early Teutonic
pottery like the coiled Pueblo pots, or other products
where the pressure of the fingers on the exterior has
generated the whole ornamental scheme.”</p></div>

<p>Antique references to finger-print patterns are not
numerous. In the anatomical text-books of my student
days, I cannot recall a single example of their having
been noticed or figured, and no figure was printed in the<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
usual plates of anatomy of my time. Malpighi, writing
in 1686, tersely alludes to the ridges which, he says,
form different patterns (<i>diversas figuras describunt</i>).</p>

<p>Both Sir William Herschel and myself have publicly
called for evidence of the alleged use in the Far East of
finger-prints being used for identification. During my
residence in Japan I was intimate with the leading
antiquarians, and was repeatedly assured that nothing
was known by them of any such legal process. Mr. T.&nbsp;W.
Rhys Davids, Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society,
of which I was formerly a member, wrote me in answer
to an inquiry as to this point, on the 17th May, <span class="nowrap">1905:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have heard of thumb marks being
used in the East as sign-manuals, but I know no
single case of thumb or finger marks being used for
identification, and, pending further information, I do
not believe they ever were so used in ancient times
in any part of the East.”</p></div>

<p>Every now and again I receive letters telling me of
some one who thinks he remembers some one saying
that he saw, etc., etc. Now, surely, it would not be
difficult if anyone were to find such evidence, to send
a copy or photograph duly authenticated, and a date
attested subsequent to the date of publication by
<i>Nature</i>, in 1880, of the correspondence on this subject.
A good deal has been written about Professor J.&nbsp;E.
Purkenje (or Purkinje) in this connection. One enthusiastic
fellow-countryman has mentioned with eulogy a
purely imaginary course of lectures on Identification
by Finger-Prints. Purkinje does not seem ever to have
dreamed of putting them to such a use. In <i>The Daily
News</i> of January 23rd, 1911, an interview is reported
with Sir Edward Henry, who is made to state that<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
Purkinje “wrote about the value of finger-prints for
purposes of identification”; but on enquiry Sir Edward
assured me he had not said anything beyond what was
stated in his work on Finger-Prints, and in that work,
of course, no such statement is hinted at as that Purkinje
proposed to secure identification by finger-prints.</p>

<p>As a student I was fairly well acquainted with much of
what that keen observer had written, and when I was
lecturing to medical students in Japan on the Testimony
of the Senses, I could not help noticing that while
Purkinje had been busy with the fingers and with the
special development in their sensitive tips of the organs
of touch, no records had been preserved which mentioned
his notice of the finger-furrows or the patterns made
by them. I took much trouble in the matter, writing
to eminent authorities and to librarians, and found no
trace of any such work. Sir F. Galton, in his published
writings, is quite in accord with me so far, but he has not
explained how he came to think of Purkinje’s work.
Writing in 1892 on <i>Finger-Prints</i>, (p.&nbsp;85) he says of the
subsequent discovery of a thesis of 58 pages: “No copy
of the pamphlet existed in any public medical library in
England, nor in any private one, so far as I could
learn; neither could I get a sight of it at some important
Continental libraries. One copy was known of it in
America.” The American copy was not known generally
till I had made vigorous enquiries there. Sir F. Galton
adds, “The very zealous librarian of the Royal College
of Surgeons was so good as to take much pains at my
instance to procure one: his zeal was happily and unexpectedly
rewarded by success, and the copy is now
securely lodged in the library of the college.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p>

<p>As Sir Francis began to give attention to this subject
in 1888 (p.&nbsp;2 of work just quoted) it is only justice to myself
in the matter to state that in June, 1886, I called on the
then librarian of the Royal College and impressed upon
him my conviction that as nothing had then been known
of any printed work by Purkinje on this topic, a search
among his remaining papers should be made, as to me
it seemed improbable that, working so closely in that
field, Purkinje could fail to observe the patterns of the
finger-furrows. It seemed as certain a deduction to me
as was that of the existence of Neptune before that
planet had been actually discovered. The pamphlet
is in Latin, a work of 58 pages, printed at Vratislav,
(i.e., Breslau) in 1823. In the article on “Finger-Prints,”
in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> (1911) it is
stated that “the permanent character of the finger-print
was put forward scientifically in 1823 by J.&nbsp;E.
Purkinje, an eminent professor of physiology, who read
a paper before the university of Breslau,” etc. But he
was surely not a professor when graduating, and what
passage in that thesis, may I ask, deals scientifically
with the <i>permanent character</i> of the finger-print?
Purkinje had studied the lineations of monkeys as well
as those of men.</p>

<p>In <i>Tristram Shandy</i> (1765) we read of “the marks of
a snuffy finger and thumb.”</p>

<p><i>Jack Shepherd</i>, a novel of Ainsworth’s, was published
in 1839. One Van Galgebrook, a Dutch conjuror,
therein foretells Jack’s bad end: “From a black mole
under the child’s right ear, shaped like a coffin <span class="ell">..</span>. and
a deep line just above the middle of the left thumb,
meeting round about in the form of a noose.” It would<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
be interesting to know how Ainsworth happened upon
the suggestion.</p>

<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Single Finger-Print</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Bewick sometimes jestingly left his sign-mark on his
fine wood-engravings, and those thus attested by his
thumb-print are now specially valued.</p>

<p>Many references occur in modern literature to fingerprints,
and in <i>David Copperfield</i>, published in complete
form in 1850, Charles Dickens tells how Dan’l Peggotty,
in the old boat-house at Yarmouth, “printed off fishy
impressions of his thumb on all the cards he found.”</p>

<p>Pater, in 1871, writing of the
Poetry of Michelangelo, mentions
“the little seal of red wax which
the stranger entering Bologna
must carry on the thumb of
his right hand.”</p>


<p>Later references are very common after the eighties.
Alix in 1867–8 wrote on the papillary lines of hand and
foot in <i>Zoologie</i>, vols. viii. and ix., contributions which
were first brought to my notice after the publication of
my <i>Guide</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1879 I engaged a Japanese engraver in Tokyo to
make for me copperplate forms in which to receive impressions
of the fingers of both hands in their consecutive
or serial order. There were spaces for information
to be recorded which might be useful in anthropology,
and a place to which a lock of hair of the subject was to
be attached. The original proof sheet, marked by me
in red pencil where special points in the rugæ were to be
carefully printed, is now in the library of The Royal
Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow, along
with a letter to me from Charles Darwin on the subject<span class="pagenum hide" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
of finger-prints. The figures are from reduced photographs
of those two original copperplate forms, which
have never before been published except as accompanying
the circular mentioned below. Many of those forms
were sent to travellers and residents in foreign countries,
with a written circular, as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sig">“January, 1880.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“I am at present engaged in a comparative study
of the <i>rugæ</i>, or skin-furrows, of the hands of different
races, and would esteem it as a great favour if you
should obtain for me nature-prints from the palmar
surface of the fingers of any of the .................. race
in your vicinity, in accordance with the enclosed
forms. The points of special interest are marked
[with red crosses] and no others need specially be
attended to. Each point must be printed by itself
separately. Printer’s ink put on very thinly and
evenly, so as not to obliterate the furrows of the skin,
is best. It can easily be removed by benzine or
turpentine. In place of that, burnt cork mixed with
<i>very little</i> oil will do very well. One or two trials had
better be made before printing on the forms. If
printing should be found too difficult, sketches of
leading lines&mdash;at the points indicated&mdash;would still
be of very great value, taking care that the directions
corresponded with the furrows, and not in <i>reverse</i>,
as when a simple impression is taken. If any one
finger, and so on, comes out badly, a piece of paper
can be printed and pasted on at the proper place. I
enclose as a specimen a filled-up form. [The fingers
printed in the proper spaces and the important
‘points’ each marked with a cross in red pencil.]</p>

<p>“As novel and valuable ethnological results are expected
from this enquiry, I trust this may form a
sufficient excuse for asking you to take so much
trouble. Please return any forms which may be
filled up to the above address.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="pr30pc">“I am, etc.,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Henry Faulds</span>.”<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Many of these circulars were posted with great care
to recent addresses, but the response was quite disappointing.
No useful prints were obtained, and most
recipients took no notice whatever of the request. I
have since thought the question may have been confused
with palmistry. It was not easy to get impressions
from the paws of monkeys, apes, and lemuroids in Japan.
Some few that were obtained at once betrayed a very
strong similarity to those of man, and it seemed that a
wider study would yield some hints, perchance, as to the
path of man’s ascent.</p>

<p>On the 15th February of the same year (1880),
I wrote to the great pioneer in this field, Charles Darwin,
sending specimens of prints and some outline of my first
tentative results, and requesting him to aid me in obtaining
access to imprints from lemurs, lemuroids, monkeys
and anthropoid apes, as I had found them to show lineation
patterns which I hoped might be serviceable to
elucidate in some degree the lineage of man. I had failed
to find any trace of references to these phenomena in
any anatomical or biological work within reach. The
few Oriental works I had seen were full of absurd phantasies
and were allied to palmistry, but contained
Buddhist and Taouist figures nowhere to be found in
nature.</p>

<p>The great naturalist’s reply, in his own handwriting,
sent to me two years before his death, was as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>“The subject to which you refer in your letter of
February 15th seems to me a curious one, which may<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
turn out interesting; but I am sorry to say that I am
most unfortunately situated for offering you any
assistance. I live in the country, and from weak
health seldom see anyone. I will, however, forward
your letter to Mr. F. Galton, who is the most likely
man that I can think of to take up the subject to
make further enquiries.</p>

<p>

</p></div>

<p>This letter, with the envelope addressed by Mr.
Darwin himself, and showing its postmarks, is in the
library of the Royal Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons.
Mr. F. Galton, afterwards Sir Francis Galton, a cousin
of Charles Darwin, wrote in <i>Finger-Prints</i>, which was
published by him in 1892, that his “attention was first
drawn to the ridges in 1888 when preparing a lecture on
Personal Identification for the Royal Institution, which
had for its principal object an account of the anthropometric
method of Bertillon, then newly introduced into
the prison administration of France.” [p.&nbsp;2.]</p>

<p>In <i>Nature</i>, October 28th, 1880, appeared my article
which was indexed shortly afterwards as the first contribution
on the subject, in the <i>Index Medicus</i> of the
United States, thus: “Faulds, H.&mdash;On the skin-furrows
of the hand, <i>Nature</i>, London, xxii, 605.”</p>

<p>Professor Otto Schlaginhaufen, while my <i>Guide</i> was
going through the press in England, published in the
August number of <i>Gegenbaur’s Jahrbüch</i> for 1905 a
copiously illustrated and well-informed article on the
lineations in human beings, lemuroids, apes and anthropoids.
The writer does me the honour of stating (p.&nbsp;584)
that with my contribution to <i>Nature</i> in 1880, there begins<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
a new period in the investigation of the lineations of the
skin, that, namely, in which they were brought into the
service of criminal anthropology and medical jurisprudence.
This publication, he says, is the forerunner
of a copious literature which flowed over into the popular
magazines and daily press, and promises to keep no
bounds. He thinks that I pointed the right way to
attain a knowledge of man’s genetic descent by a study
of the corresponding lineations of certain lower animals,
such as lemuroids, and that I had suggested other directions
in which medical jurisprudence might profitably
engage in the study of this subject. A claim was shortly
afterwards made in <i>Nature</i>, by Sir William Herschel, that
he had, prior to my efforts, taken finger-prints for
identification in India. I have entered into this personal
matter elsewhere. Sir William has more than once
publicly conceded priority of publication to me, and that
is not at all disputable. We quite independently reached
similar conclusions. Schlaginhaufen sums up the matter
at least impartially, <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Zeitlich erschien die Publikation <span class="smcap">Faulds’</span>
früher; aber <span class="smcap">Herschel</span> wies durch die Veröffentlichung
eines halboffiziellen Briefes nach dass er sich
schon 1877 mit dem Gegendstand beschäftigt habe.
Jedenfalls sind beide Beobachter unabhängig voneinander
auf die gleiche Idee gekommen, und wenn auch
die Materialien, die <span class="smcap">Herschel</span> lieferte, für die kriminelle
Anthropologie speziell von grösserer Bedeutung
waren, so hat <span class="smcap">Faulds’</span> doch in seiner ersten Mitteilung
die Erforschung der Hautleisten von einem höheren
Gesichtspunkt aus erfasst und ihr in einem umfassenderen
Plan den Weg vorgezeichnet.”</p></div>

<p>That is to <span class="nowrap">say:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Faulds’s publication was earlier in time, but
Herschel showed by the publication of a half-official<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
letter that he had been engaged with the method from
1877 onwards. In any case both observers had independently
come to the same idea, and while the
material which Herschel supplied was of greater
service for criminal anthropology, Faulds had in his
first communication grasped the investigation of the
skin lineations from a higher standpoint, and had
indicated the way to it through a more comprehensive
plan.”</p></div>

<p>My own plan laid stress on the serial imprint of five or
ten fingers according to the size of the registers anticipated.
Sir William Herschel used one, two, or three
fingers only, and chiefly as sign-manuals. Sir William
has since published a hand imprint used as a sign-manual
and printed in 1858. On seeing the announcement I
wrote to the publishers, who regretted they could not
supply me with a copy as it was printed for private
circulation only. Sir William Herschel has nowhere
claimed to have had any methodic way of storing or
indexing the records, and indeed, from his indications,
they cannot have been at all numerous.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1887 and 1888, after my final return to England,
I brought the method under the notice of the Home
Authorities, who merely dealt with it in the usual red-tape
methods. Finally, I asked to have one of their
most intelligent officers appointed to meet me, so that
I might enter fully into practical details. In reply
there came to me a gentleman who sent in his official<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
card, which I have in my possession now. This
was the able officer so well known by his dramatic
capture of Mr. Jabez Balfour. I showed him how
printing was done, the method of classification adopted
by me, and offered to form a model bureau from the
hands of the London police. A few years ago Mr.
Tunbridge wrote <span class="nowrap">me:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have a most distinct and pleasant recollection
of our interview, and since the ‘F.&nbsp;P.’ system has
been adopted as a means of identification of criminals
with such marked success, have often wondered how it
was that you have not been more actively connected
with the carrying out of the system. When the Home
Authorities recognized the value of the system, I was
Commissioner of Police in New Zealand, and it was
owing mainly to my recommendation that the system
was introduced into the New Zealand prisons,
although the Prison Authorities were somewhat
opposed to it<span class="ell">...</span>. Some of the Australian States
also adopted the system, with the result that an interchange
of prints took place, which soon manifested its
value. The system is now in full working order in
Australia, and is carried on by the police, of course,
with the assistance of the Prison Authorities.”</p></div>

<p>No report has been published of Mr. Tunbridge’s
impressions. At the close of our long interview he told
me he was disposed to think the method would be rather
delicate for practical application by the police, and that
fresh legislation would be required before any beginning
could be made.</p>

<p>In 1897, the finger-print system associated with
Monsieur Bertillon’s anthropometric system was adopted
in India; but soon the bodily measurements were abandoned,
and the finger-print method alone was officially
employed; and in 1901 it was tentatively used in
England and Wales, but did not come into much public<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
use till a year or two afterwards. The ten-finger method
in serial order, as I had from the first recommended for
a large register, and prepared forms to receive imprints
(as shown in <i>facsimile</i>), was adopted and is that now
in official use. The methods of Sir William Herschel,
followed by that of Sir F. Galton, were much more
restricted, and could never have been worked practically
in anything but a very small and limited register.</p>

<p>The finger-print system of identification is all but
universally applied now throughout the civilized world
for criminal cases, and bids fairly well to be soon adopted
for other methods of identification than that of professional
criminals or recidivists. After great earthquakes,
floods, or battles, multitudes of people have to be
hastily buried who have never been fully identified. In
such cases the existence of a civil or military Finger-print
Register would be a very great means of security,
and this it is my great wish to see recognized and
established.</p>

<p>I wish to make it clear that in 1880 no printed proposal
existed to use finger-prints for identification. Sir F.
Galton has referred to a United States expedition in
which the method was used, but the date was 1882, and
the example printed could not identify. He also refers
to Mr. Tabor, of San Francisco, who had proposed the
registration of Chinamen by this method, as their
identity was difficult to establish. I believe this also
was in 1882. In a criticism of Dr. Schlaginhaufen’s
Bibliography (“F.G.” is the signature) in <i>Nature</i>, the
omission of Mr. Tabor’s name is regretted, but why?
Did he write on the subject anything which has been
preserved? Why, before this period, Dr. Billings,<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
of the United States Army, said at the International
Medical Congress: “Just as each individual is
in some respects peculiar and unique, so that even
the minute ridges and furrows at the end of his forefingers
differ from that of all other forefingers, and is
sufficient to identify,” etc. So that in America the matter
was widely known, and Dr. Billings’ own work on the
“Index” attributed its initiation to me.</p>

<p>Again, in 1883, “Mark Twain” published his charming
<i>Life on the Mississippi</i>, a very valuable human
document. It contains a well-thought-out story of an
identification by means of a thumb-print on a system
supposed by him to have been invented by a French
prison doctor. His <i>Pudd’nhead Wilson</i>, in which a still
better study of the subject occurs, did not come out till
1894, the year in which the sitting of Mr. Asquith’s
Committee on Identification of Habitual Criminals
had set journalists agoing again on the theme of “thumb-prints.”
Prior to that year a great deal had been written
on the subject, the facts being chiefly taken from the
correspondence in <i>Nature</i>, to which reference has been
made.</p>

<p>The front or palmar surface of human hands, and the
corresponding solar or plantar surface of the feet, are
marked with alternate ridges and furrows, lying for the
most in nearly parallel rows, but often again at certain
points on palm or sole, curving, splitting, twisting, or
joining to form patterns of much intricacy. The ridges,
called technically <i>rugæ</i> (sing. <i>ruga</i>), are punctuated at
very frequent intervals with small openings, which are
the mouths or pores of the
sweat ducts connected
with certain glands which
lie deep in the lower strata
of the skin. The furrows
or <i>sulci</i> (sing. <i>sulcus</i>) are
almost devoid of any such
apertures. There are
probably some two or
three millions of those
tiny sweat pores in a
human body, which afford
an evaporating surface,
according to the anatomist
Krause, of about eight
square inches. The
sweat is a watery, slightly
saline fluid, with slight<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>&mdash;very slight&mdash;traces
of grease, some small cell-like
particles, and some carbonic acid and other gaseous
matters, which exhale from the skin. The more oily
secretion of the skin comes from a different set of openings
with their associated glands, the sebaceous glands,
which are associated with the hairy surfaces of the body.
In Ludwig Hopf’s work, <i>The Human Species</i>, the subject
is discussed fully. When the palmar surface leaves a
distinctly greasy impression, this greasiness must have
been acquired from outside or from transmitted exudation
from the back or dorsal surfaces, or other parts
of the body.</p>

<p>Those skin ridges, apart from any relation they may
have either to the sweat-pores or to the special nerves
of touch and temperature which lie near them, serve a
useful purpose in helping the horny hands of toil to grasp
its tools firmly. They occur in a few other parts of
animals somewhat near to us in the scale of being. A
striking example is that on the palmar surface of the
prehensile or grasping tail of the Spider Monkey (<i>Ateles
ater</i>), which it uses in climbing almost like a hand.</p>

<p>When the ridges in human fingers are well softened
with water, and are then rubbed along the surface of a
tumbler or wine-glass, musical sounds may be elicited,
which are caused by the alternate resistance and yielding
of the softened ridges. This was the principle of
the “musical glasses” of Goldsmith’s time. The navvy
often begins his labours by moistening his loof. After
his efforts make him perspire, he has no further need in
this way for his salivary resources. Hence Nature, too,
has placed the openings of the sweat-pores on the crests
of his ridges, and not, as Herbert Spencer on one occasion<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
is said to have supposed she had done, in the troughs of
the furrows, where they are very seldom to be found,
and would not be nearly so useful. Curiously enough,
our modern makers of indiarubber tyres work a trademark
pattern or title in ridges on their wares, so as to
secure a good grip on the road&mdash;and on the market. In
a similar way the carriers of Manchuria adorn their
clumsy wheels with studs to prevent their skidding.</p>

<p>There are, as has been mentioned, two kinds of minute
glands in the skin: one, to secrete that complex excretion,
the sweat; the other, to provide a certain greasiness
to hair. The latter are found chiefly in other parts than
the palms, and serve to secure that slight oiliness of the
surface of our bodies which is very well seen in taking
one’s bath. However thoroughly that thin film of
surface greasiness is removed with the use of soap and
vigorous scrubbing, in a moment or two water is seen
to act on the cutaneous surface as it would on a slightly
greasy platter or a duck’s back. The importance of this
point will become apparent when we come to deal with
some practical applications of dactylography in searching
for invisible greasy finger-marks, which may be made
visible.</p>

<p>Looking carefully at the visible texture of the fingers
and palms, we see, then, that the cutaneous ridges lie,
for the most part, closely and evenly, like furrows in a
well-ploughed field. But just as in some fields the ploughman
has perforce had to swerve and veer round some
fast embedded boulder or old tree stump, varying his
intended pattern, so, too, in our fingers curious divergent
lineations are found to occur, and we cannot very well
tell the reason why. Coloured patches may be designed<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
like so many pretty wall-paper designs, to enclose these
patterns in books on finger-prints, but I, for one, cannot
see that they throw any light on their genuine nature
and origin. We find, under purely mechanical conditions,
similar patterns produced in the ripples of a sub-aerial
sand-drift and on a tidal shore. While writing
this chapter, I saw to-day similar deltas, junctions,
forks, and the like, on a lake whose frozen surface was
thinly sprinkled with fine dry snow. The lines were
mostly parallel, but where certain gusts or eddies had
occurred they had been broken up into patterns not
unlike those of finger-tips.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/032.jpg" width="350" height="291" alt="" />
<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Ripple Marks in Sand</span> (<i>After Lyell</i>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>In human skin, and in the anthropoid apes, those
scroll-like patterns present almost infinite varieties of
detail, and they often resemble a condensed railway
plan, showing junctions, blind sidings, loops, triangles,
and curves. There is one important distinction to be<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
observed. The lineations of skin ridges are not always
quite uniform in breadth, but broaden out sometimes
or dwindle away. Again, they are dotted with sweat-pores
and do not always, when printed from, show those
pores in the same degree of patency or openness. Hence
a little variation is inevitable when the same finger is
several times impressed under varying conditions. It
is not to be forgotten that, to a limited extent, this is
true of a rigid box-wood engraving or steel plate, or
lithographic stone, which give somewhat divergent
results with varying degrees of pressure in printing,
moisture of atmosphere or paper, and other conditions.</p>

<p>In this country the feet do not afford a favourable
field of study to the dactylographer. So far as identification
is concerned, little use could be made of them
practically. In the East, however, it is different, and
many years’ residence there gave me opportunities to
observe that the toes, unrestrained by the use of stiff
leather boots, are mobile and powerful, grasping as
fingers do. The carpenter in Japan, for example, uses
his toes to grip and steady the board he is sawing or
hewing, while many of my readers must be familiar with
the extraordinary agility of Japanese acrobats in the
use of their feet and toes. In those cases the ridges are
often varied in grouping, and well defined in development.
A European baby generally begins life with
similar simian-like powers. But so far as my own
observations go, the patterns in the hands usually show
a somewhat higher degree of evolution, a more complex
and intricate network of lines, than those exhibited by
the feet of the same person. Hence, apart from the
greater convenience of inspecting them, the finger-prints<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
have greater value for the purpose of identification.
Cases, however, of crime, might readily occur even in
this country, where the imprints of naked feet might
yield important and irrefutable evidence of one’s presence
at a scene of evil-doing.</p>

<p>But there are other important points of scientific
interest besides their evidential value for identification.
An important problem in evolutionary development, on
which a considerable amount of literature begins to
accumulate, is the serial relation of the limbs. Professor
Bowditch, the distinguished biologist, of Harvard
University, U.S., wrote me, of date November 18th,
1880, <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just read in <i>Nature</i> of October
28th, your article on the skin-furrows of the hand.
The subject interested me because it so happened that
fourteen years ago, at the suggestion of the late
Professor Jeffries Wyman, I made some prints of the
finger and toe tips with the hope of throwing some
light on the question of the antero-posterior symmetry
of the body. Since reading your article I have
made some new impressions from the same individual,
and it is interesting to notice the unchanged character
of the cutaneous furrows.”</p></div>

<p>Some additional particulars are added in the letter,
and a fine finger imprint was enclosed.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that the comparison of the
ridges to those of a ploughed field does not always, and
in every way, hold good. As I have elsewhere said<span class="nowrap">:<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The lines are not of uniform width. Ofttimes they
may be likened rather to the mountains and valleys
in a good survey. The ridges sometimes split or send
little spurs down into the neighbouring valleys; at
other times a ridge seems to cleave, giving rise to a form<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
like a tarn or lake in a limestone range: here and
there solitary islands rise in the valleys, and sometimes
quite an archipelago takes the place of some of the
commoner patterns. Indeed, the ordinary nomenclature
of an ordinary physical geography map may be
found quite helpful in laying a case clearly before a
magistrate or a jury. And just as we find in the case
of mountains and valleys in a map, every variety of
shape may occur in a finger-pattern.”</p></div>

<p>Here it may be as well to state, as we shall
see more precisely further on, that an English
jury is well enabled to judge of the conformity of two
patterns, one of which is suspect only, and the other
officially printed from the fingers of some one in custody&mdash;by
great photographic enlargement of the exhibits
in the case, used as evidence.</p>

<p>The ridges, as may be seen by an enlarged photograph
(as on frontispiece), do not always continue to be of quite
uniform width throughout. Sometimes they taper away
sharply like a railway point, or trickle off in diminishing
dots; or again, especially where something like triangles
occur, called deltas (after the Greek letter, Δ <i>delta</i>),
they flatten out in breadth considerably. In old age
they are found usually to have partaken of the general
drying up and shrivelling of the tissues.</p>

<p>In the cold or shivering stage of ague and fevers, and
in the affection called Reynaud’s disease, in which the
fingers may tend to become pale and bloodless, some
slight shrinking of the ridges also takes place, a point
which might be of importance in the measurement of
enlarged exhibits in the trial, for example, of an old
Indian soldier or traveller who had been subject to fits
of ague.</p>

<p>I have heard Sir A. Moseley Channel, who has<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
informed himself well about finger-print matters, in
a charge to a jury in a murder case, refer to the
doubtful and unsatisfactory nature of evidence from
a print done by a sweaty finger.</p>

<p>The fact that sweaty finger-marks have been adduced
in evidence of crime makes it important for lawyers,
police officials, judges and jurymen, to understand
what is meant by such natural records. A mark from
pure sweat would necessarily be excessively transient,
as it consists chiefly of water and salines, and should
properly contain no greasy matter whatever. Dr.
Reginald Alcock, of the North Stafford Infirmary, in a
recent paper read at Stoke-on-Trent, and since republished
in <i>The British Medical Journal</i>, described his
researches into the relation of the sweat-pores to practical
surgery, and to the recognized difficulty in sterilising
the skin for subsequent operation. Dr. Alcock shows
that there may often be found remaining, after the best
efforts to cleanse the surface, a stubborn residue of live
and obnoxious matter in those tiny invisible ducts,
matter which had insidiously gained entrance from
without. Now such decaying or dead particles of foreign
protoplasm would, I think, readily enough account for
the very faint traces of oily matter sometimes observed,
which oiliness makes sweat from a skin, fair and clean in
the ordinary sense, leave slight but somewhat persistent
traces on such substances as glass and the like.</p>

<p>In a case reported some time ago, in <i>The Birmingham
Post</i>, Detective-Sergeant Charles Munro, on cross-examination
as to a sweaty smudge left on glass, said:
“The impressions on the window-pane were sweat-marks.
They had conducted experiments in Scotland<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
Yard, and ascertained that sweat-marks lasted on glass
for a week if not exposed to the wind.” Here, I suppose,
the distinction between a sweat-mark proper and a somewhat
greasy sweat-mark was not discerned. Even a
deliberately designed greasy mark is volatile to a certain
extent just as the oil of new paint dries in a day or two
according to the weather.</p>

<p>In the <i>Guide</i> (p.&nbsp;65) I have alluded to the fact of
coloured sweat or <i>Chromidrosis</i>, <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A blackish ooze takes place in some hysterical
cases. More striking is the class of cases in which the
colouring matter is derived, like the bright colours in
the plumage of parrots, from copper, and in some cases
from iron. Workers in copper have been found subject
to it. The sweat is generally of a bluish colour
in those cases. Red sweat has been observed in lockjaw.
A kind of saffron colour I have found to be not
very uncommon in some classes of malarious cases.
One lady I attended had an extraordinary temperature
during some of the attacks, the thermometer
recording 110° Fahrenheit. With a temperature of
about 104° Fahr. she did not seem to be really unwell.
I took good impressions at one of those times, with the
yellow-coloured sweat. Ordinarily, however, sweat
does not help, but hinder, impressions from being made.
A case of blue sweat came under my treatment quite
recently. There was no history of copper poisoning.”</p></div>

<p>Since writing the above, I have met with other cases
of coloured sweat. My teacher, the late Sir Thomas
McCall Anderson, in his work, <i>Contributions to Clinical
Medicine</i>, mentions some very interesting facts in this
connection in the chapter on “Hemidrosis.”</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer, in the May number of the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i> (1886), discussing the Factors of Organic
Evolution, explains the origin of the ridges in a passage
which I must quote in <span class="nowrap">full:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Continuous pressure on any portion of the surface
causes absorption, while intermittent pressure causes
growth: the one impeding circulation and the passage
of plasma from the capillaries into the tissues, and the
other aiding both. There are yet further mechanically
produced effects. That the general character of the
ribbed skin on the under-surfaces of the feet and inside
of the hands, is directly due to friction and
intermitten pressure, we have the proofs: first, that
the tracks most exposed to rough usage are the most
ribbed; second, that the insides of hands subject to
unusual amounts of rough usage, as those of sailors,
are strongly ribbed all over; and third, that in hands
which are very little used, the parts commonly ribbed
become quite smooth.”</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>FINGER-PRINT PATTERNS</h3>


<p>Before reading this chapter, let the reader carefully
examine the clear lineations shown so well in the photographic
picture of the Zebra’s stripes, opposite. They
will be found to resemble very closely the lineations on
the skin of human fingers, as printed when enlarged by
photography, forming very similar patterns. Similar
linings occur in the hide of the tiger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">
<img src="images/039fp.jpg" width="525" height="381" alt="" />
<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Grevy’s Zebra.</span>&mdash;Showing Lineations like Finger-Print Patterns.</p></div>
</div>
<p class="sig fs70">[Photo. Pictorial Agency]</p>

<p>Where two lines, beginning as parallels, curve to
divide, a fresh line begins to appear between. Sometimes
a single line forks into two or three. Again, triangular
arrangements of lineations are seen on the zebra, and
one can trace some of these back into lines running as a
parallel series. Surely the causes which produce the
ridges on a human or anthropoid finger cannot be
quite the same biologically as lead to the formation of
similar patterns in the skin of the zebra. There are
mechanical or physical conditions, however, which condition
the formation of ridges in a sandy shore, of powdery
snow blown by the wind and tossed on a smooth
frozen lake, as has already been noticed, and these conditions
are being carefully elucidated by scientific
observers. But why living tissues should produce
patterns like those, just in those positions, and then
reproduce them in living descendants with slight but
important variations, is a totally different question,
the answer to which must be reached in a different way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>

<p>While the ridges and furrows lie in parallels or curve
in the same direction over some considerable surface of
the sole and palm, they also gather up into more or less
intricate, scroll-like patterns at various points besides
those of the last joints of the fingers, which have chiefly
engrossed popular attention hitherto. In man, the
lemurs, lemuroids, and apes, these pattern points are
numerous. In my own hands, there are on the left
hand, besides the five finger-tip patterns, other five like
them, and the right hand contains six. There are thus
twenty-one <i>complex</i> patterns which might be used for
identification.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when one reads of a mathematical
attempt to compute the probabilities of two
finger-prints being alike, it is not a question simply of
comparing an unknown finger smudge with collections
containing ten finger-prints each, for the unknown
smudge may have been made, not from one of a possible
set of ten finger-tip prints, but from one of those other
local patterns not on the finger-tips at all. There is
a saying often attributed to Huxley, who certainly used
it wisely, that the value of grist from the mathematical
mill depends on the quality of the corn put into the
hopper. But official amateur mathematicians have
made many much worse mistakes than the above in
regard to probabilities in the realm of finger-print
evidence.</p>

<p>In a few cases, especially in the feet patterns, often a
very plain character, parallel or slightly wavy lines of
no precise design, so to speak, may be found. A short
time ago, when applying mustard to the feet of a lady
in some kind of fit, I observed this almost featureless<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
pattern in her toes. If such cases were as common in
the hands as they are rare, the finger-print method would
hardly be of any avail for identification. A teleologist
of the old school of Paley might argue with some plausibility
that the possible usefulness of those intricate
patterns was the true meaning of their existence, otherwise
not yet explainable. That the old Paleyan conception
of nature having an end or purpose in view, the
teleological explanation of things as useful to the being
possessing them, had its own usefulness in giving a
broader view of natural history facts in their interrelations,
is borne out even by so great an authority as
Charles Darwin himself. Are the markings in a bird’s
eggs recognized by the sitting bird in those cases where
the markings are peculiar&mdash;and some are like written
characters&mdash;or are they purely accidental and useless?
A correspondent in <i>The Country-Side</i> wrote a short time
ago, describing a test case he observed of a thrush in his
possession. This bird built a nest and laid therein five
eggs, “varying in size from a good-sized pea to the
normal size. The smaller ones I took away and substituted
one from a wild bird’s nest; this the following
day I found laid at the bottom of the aviary smashed.
I again repeated the addition with the same result.
I had carefully marked the eggs, so that there could be
no mistake.” The writer signed himself “W.&nbsp;A.,
Wimbledon.”</p>

<p>Dr. Wallace’s view, as I understand it, is that variations
in wild animals were due chiefly to immunity from
enemies, allowing free play to the natural tendency to
variation, kept only in check by its dangers, such as
leading to betrayal by conspicuous colouring, and so on.<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
Professor Poulton in <i>The Colours of Animals</i>, 2nd ed.
p. 212, <span class="nowrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is very probable that the great variation in the
colours and markings of birds’ eggs, which are laid
close together in immense numbers, may possess this
significance, enabling each bird to know its own eggs.
I owe this suggestive interpretation to my friend,
Mr. Francis Gotch: it is greatly to be hoped that
experimental confirmation may be forthcoming. The
suggestion could be easily tested by altering the
position of the eggs and modifying their appearance
by painting. Mr. Gotch’s hypothesis was formed
after seeing a large number of eggs of the guillemot
in their natural surroundings.”</p></div>

<p>Australian ewes know the bleat of their own lambs,
however immense the flock, and all through nature we
find this useful note of recognition. One of the most
philosophic interpreters of living phenomena, viewing
things from a very recent standpoint&mdash;Professor J.
Arthur Thomson, in his fascinating <i>Biology of the
Seasons</i> (p.&nbsp;174), writing of the colour and texture of
birds’ eggs, <span class="nowrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In some cases, it is said, the shell registers hybridism&mdash;a
very remarkable fact. It is another illustration
of the great, though still vague, truth that the
living creature is a unity through and through, specific
even in the structure of the egg-shell within which it
is developed. For although the shell is secreted by
the walls of the oviduct, it seems to be in some measure
controlled by the life of the giant-cell&mdash;the ovum&mdash;within.”</p></div>

<p>Such pattern-forming qualities are found in many
fields of nature, very beautifully, for example, as we have
seen, in the skin of the zebra; on the back of a mackerel;
in the grain of various kinds of wood; in the veining of
leaves and petals; and in the covering or substance<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
of seeds such as the nutmeg and scarlet runner bean.
Sir Charles Lyell, in his <i>Elements of Geology</i>, figures the
ribbing of sand on the sea-shore in a wood-cut which
might be an enlarged diagram of human skin. (See fig.
on page <a href="#Page_32">32</a>). In his <i>Principles of Geology</i> (5th ed.,
vol. i., p.&nbsp;323) there is, again, a figure described as a
section of “spheroidal concretionary Travertine,” which
contains many linings strikingly like those with which
we have to deal in this little work.</p>

</table>

<p>It follows from these analogies that a method of
analysing and classifying such patterns might have very
wide utilities beyond
its relation to finger-prints.
It is easy, for
example, to recognize
the same zebra in quite
different pictures.
Another point of practical
importance is
this, that a smudgy or
blotchy impression,
supposed to be that of a criminal present at some seat of
crime, might be the impressed copy merely of some
object or texture other than human skin, but containing
lineations of similar arrangement. An outworn transversely
cut branch of a tree might readily produce a
print like that of a human finger. An expert would
probably notice that in the lineations there were no
real junctions, each woody ring remaining apart from
the others; but, again, there are some human fingers
of such patterns. I think the bloody smear officially
reproduced as impressed on a post-card in facsimile,<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
and purporting to have come from “Jack the Ripper,”
at the time of the Whitechapel horrors in the eighties,
may have been produced by the sleeve of a twilled coat
smeared with blood. It contained no characters specially
characteristic of skin lineations, which it was presumed
to be an example of, as impressed.</p>

<p>Apart from all that, lemurs, lemuroids, apes, anthropoids,
and monkeys, all show on hands and feet, skin
lineations in patterns similar to those of man. In the
anthropoid apes it would not be easy to discriminate
them from those of human beings. Some of these were
figured in my <i>Guide</i>, and Dr. Otto Schlaginhaufen has
supplied numerous good prints.</p>

<p>If Edgar A. Poe, in his famous mystery of evil deeds
done by a gigantic ape, had been acquainted with finger-print
methods, he might have pictured the police as still
more mystified by the imprints of seemingly human
hands.</p>

<p>There are two methods of observing systematically
the lineation patterns.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;<i>The Direct Mode.</i>&mdash;This might be done simply by
many people by looking at the lineations with the unaided
vision. Till quite recently the author found no
difficulty in doing this, with myopic eyes that could see
something of the texture of a house-fly’s eyes in a good
light. My earliest observations of the finger-patterns
were made in this way, while the patterns were reproduced
in pencilled outlines. The condition of the actual
ridges and furrows themselves, with their open and acting
or closed and dormant sweat-pores, ought to be
familiar to the student of dactylography, who is apt to
narrow his vision by the contemplation only of dead<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
impressions made in ink or otherwise. A lens such as
botanists use for field work is very useful, and a high
power is neither necessary nor very helpful. Drawings
of the patterns ought to be made from time to time
with coloured or “lead” pencils, and those drawings
should be accurately adjusted by the use of rubber and
compasses.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;<i>The Indirect Method.</i>&mdash;This is done by the medium
of casts and printed impressions. Casts may be made of
clay, putty, sealing-wax, beeswax, gutta-percha, hard
paraffin, varnish, half-dry paint, and the like. Printed
impressions or dactylographs may be obtained from
greasy or sweaty fingers, blood, printer’s ink, or various
substitutes for it.</p>

<p>Within this method, again, two very distinct and
complementary kinds of results may be obtained, which
I have elsewhere described as Positive and Negative.
The first or Positive is that, for example, which is used
officially for the record of convicted prisoners by printing
with ordinary printer’s ink, just as a veined leaf or fern,
or a box-wood engraving is printed from. Here the
ridges or raised lines appear black on a white ground,
while the intervening furrows appear white, as do also
the minute pores dotted along the crest of each ridge.
(See <a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a>.)</p>

<p>In the other method, as when the fingers are impressed
on a carefully smoked surface of glass, the projecting
ridges lift up the carbon of the soot, leaving a white
pattern behind, with the sweat-pores forming black
punctuations, while the receding furrows leave the
black surface untouched. When such impressions
have to be used again, as for evidence, they should<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
be carefully varnished, as they are exceedingly liable
to be destroyed by the slightest contact.</p>

<p>In a case under judicial investigation where an official
imprint had to be compared with one done by accident
negatively on smoked glass or the like, the black lineations
would not closely correspond&mdash;would, in fact,
considerably diverge in pattern. This might tend to
confuse judge and jury if the distinction of negative and
positive dactylograph were not made clear by the expert
witness. Then the apparent divergences could easily
be demonstrated to be very significant coincidences.</p>

<p>Five years of my early life were spent in learning a
trade in Glasgow&mdash;that of the soon-to-be-obsolete
Paisley shawl manufacture. It seemed to me to have
been an utter waste of time, but part of my duty was to
deal with the arrangement, classifying, and numbering
immense varieties of patterns, printed with every conceivable
variation of combined colours. It was impossible
to carry these on memory, and one had to resort to
mnemonic means of classification.</p>

<p>Now, the immense significance of the variety in human
finger-patterns dawned upon me very early, when I had
once begun to interest myself in them.</p>

<p>There are many patterns, which, when analysed into
their composing elements, present analogies to artistic
designs, a view which is no mere personal fad, but has
been affirmed with enthusiasm by many artists in designs
to whom I have pointed out those figures. Here are a
few, by way of illustrating this point (space will not
permit of more). Those figures are from real human
finger-prints rendered diagrammatically. This is the
first step, then, to catch with the eye the pattern or<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
design; give it a class name, and you have at once
established some practical basis of classification in
finger-prints. Then it is possible to frame some kind of
catalogue for reference arranged like a dictionary with
its sub-alphabetic order, in an almost infinite series. The
initial difficulty is generally that which arises from
want of skill in printing, which technical points will be
considered subsequently. A soft and flexible substance
like the ridges in human fingers does not always yield
an exactly similar impression in two successive moments,<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
under varying conditions of temperature, fatigue, and
the like. Nor does the analogy of mathematical diagrams
always fitly apply in such a case. Even in steel
engravings and fine etchings, as the connoisseur well
knows, the degree of intensity of the pressure and other
conditions will modify to some slight extent the resulting
imprint, but what I wish to emphasize is, that if the
original pattern had any value at all resulting from its
complexity as a pattern, the variation in printing as now
done officially by experienced police officials will not
impair much its value as evidence of personal identity
in a court of law. Even the amateur will soon, after a
little practice with good materials, attain a very fair
amount of clearness and uniformity in his imprints.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>SOME BIOLOGICAL QUESTIONS IN DACTYLOGRAPHY.</h3>


<p>In this chapter I propose to bring together a few
important points of a biological character, which are so
vital that even in so curtailed a discussion they cannot
be ignored. We shall also glance&mdash;it must literally be the
merest glance&mdash;at the problem of man’s genetic descent,
in so far as it begins now to be illumined, however
faintly, by a comparative study of finger-prints. Comparatively
little of a final character has as yet been
achieved, but there are now not a few active and intelligent
observers in many lands, and the scientific results
often attained under the greatest difficulties are so far
greatly encouraging. Fortunately the day has long
passed away when it can be considered irreverent to
enquire modestly as to who were one’s ancestors. In a
very true biological sense every human individual is
known to have run through a scale of existence, beginning
from the lowest mono-cellular organism, through
something like a tadpole or salamander, into a vertebrate
and mammal type, not easily to be discriminated
from the undeveloped young of rat, or pig, or monkey.
Now, if he is not in any way individually degraded by
this actually demonstrable course of development, why
should he be thought racially degraded by an honest
scientific effort to trace the origin of his species from
lowly animal ancestry? The process may be slower,<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
but is no less determined by divinely established law.
Our grandfathers believed that the Creator breathed
into the organized and shapely form of Adam (= “a
man”) a portion of the divine spirit, by which he became
a living soul, and forthwith took his dignified place in
nature. To me the old story, when retold in more
modern and exact phrase, leads us to an entirely hopeful
and inspiring conception of the origin and evolutionary
destiny of our race.</p>

<p>When we approach the threshold of man’s first appearance
on the globe, we have reached a geologic epoch
when our sober earth seems to have sown most of its
wild oats. Its “crust” is pretty stable, and at least
in its broad distribution of sea and land, it does not seem
to differ very greatly from what its appearance presents
on a modern physiographical map. Minor differences
there must have been, as even our modern English
coast-line shows, and there may have been other conditions
than now exist to account for many of man’s
early migrations, but those differences are still matters
of discussion. There were, possibly, enough certain
bridge-like links between lands now apart and separated
by wide stretches of sea, but, as a rule, such conclusions
have been deductively reached, and are not definitely
established on scientific evidence.</p>

<p>After rising above one-celled to more complicated
organisms, we reach a class of creatures in which a
radiate or wheel-like form obtains, that is, radial
symmetry, as in jelly-fish, star-fish, urchins, and sea-anemones.</p>

<p>Fishes occupy, perhaps, about the lowest level among
the back-boned or vertebrate animals, and we may<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
readily notice that some of their fins occur in symmetrically
arranged pairs, while others, again, occur singly.
Now with this arrangement of such appendages in pairs
symmetrically arranged there begins the appearance of
something definitely like what we mean by limbs.
Some present-day fishes use some of their fins as legs to
clamber and crawl on rocks or ashore. I remember
seeing, in a Japanese tea-house by the solitary sea-shore,
not far from where the great arsenal of Yokoska
now hums busily, a very beautiful gurnard, blue as to
its outspread wings like the sapphire gurnard. Those
fins were painted like the wings of a butterfly, and it
crawled about in the limited sea-water, on rocks, under
cliffs, and among sea-weed, with butterfly-like legs or
processes from the roots of those wing-like fins. With
such a special adaptation of their fins, fishes began to
conquer the land. Seals and whales, as is well known,
are mammals which have been driven back again to
the sea.</p>

<p>Thesing, in his suggestive <i>Lectures on Biology</i> (English
translation, p.&nbsp;13), <span class="nowrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All extremities of the higher vertebrates, however
widely they may differ in construction, may be traced
back biogenetically to the so-called Ichthyopterygium,
as we see it in the lower shark-like fishes. Unequal
growth of the single skeleton parts and a considerable
reduction in their numbers transformed the Ichthyopterygium
into the five-fingered extremity characteristic
of all vertebrates from the amphibians upwards.”</p></div>

<i>b</i>, from foot of chimpanzee, left index;<br />
<i>c</i>, from foot of orang, left index.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of course the great end of an animal is at first to fill
its own belly, and in order to do this, if fixed as some
molluscs are, it must contrive to bring nutriment within
its reach, and if mobile limbs come to be developed to<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
achieve locomotion, by fin in water, limb on land, and
wing in air. After the vertebrate and mammal stage
was achieved, the five-fingered limb takes various forms,
as the paddle of the whale or wing of the bat. There are
three great periods in geological development of animals&mdash;the
Primary, which is, roughly speaking, the typical
period of fishes; the Secondary, when reptiles prevail;
and the Tertiary, the great age of mammals. Many
geologists recognize a fourth period, the Post-Tertiary,
Quaternary, or Diluvian, when existing species have
been established. It is not till this latest period has
arrived that we can detect unmistakable evidences of
man. There are, however, many reasons which lead to
the conclusion that his racial roots go still further back
in time. Did he arise as a “mutation,” one of those
rare sudden changes observed to take place even at the
present time, by which a species suddenly departs from
its ancestral type and is transformed? Let us briefly
look at the main facts of mammalian ascent. The great
herbivorous reptiles&mdash;some do not seem to have been<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
strictly herbivorous&mdash;do not seem to lead us far on our
path. Widely spread throughout the world, the
Theriomorphs or beast-shaped reptiles seem to approach
the mammal type, but they were too helpless and unwieldy,
and had little brain-power wherewith to direct
their energies. The earliest genuine mammals were
small, not only relatively to those great creatures, but
really little, rat-like rodents. Then we find arboreal
creatures, driven to the trees for refuge and for food,
squirrel-like animals, agile to escape from their monstrous
but clumsy and stupid foes on the ground, and using
their paws nimbly as hands to grasp and tear, or to
break nuts and other food.</p>

<p>Lemur-like animals (lemuroids) then come on the
stage, and among them&mdash;among the earliest of them&mdash;we
begin to detect traces, on feet and hands, of those
patterned ridges, the beginnings of which we have been
seeking. Hand and brain and voice are the trinity of
social construction. The spider and the mantis (or
praying insect) have nimble, hand-like organs&mdash;very
striking and conspicuous in the mantis; the chameleon
among reptiles, the parrot among birds, the squirrel
among lower mammals, all have somewhat hand-like
organs used in hand-like ways; but when we reach the
higher mammals, the sense of touch is finely intertwined
with the power of varied and discriminative grasping,
pressing, or rubbing. The elephant, which appears at
first in the strata as about the size of a dog, grows in
size and brain power as the ages roll along. But his
path seems now to be closing. With his sagacious
brain, and prehensile, sensitive trunk, he can do wonders,
but, like the horse, he is likely to be passed by; the great<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
tool-maker finding it easy now to make bearers swifter
or more powerful than they are.</p>

<p>It is in man and the anthropoid apes that we first find
the correspondence between hand and brain that promises
mastery. The ugly, painted mandrill, even, has
beautiful lady-like hands and takes care of them like a
lady. All the higher apes show complicated finger-patterns
like those of man.</p>

<p>The rugæ in apes and men seem clearly to have served
a most useful purpose in aiding the firm grasp of hands
or feet, a very vital point in creatures living an arboreal
life, as they and their racial predecessors are now presumed
to have done. In that case, however, would not
one pattern, a simple one, have done as well as any
other? Here, then, the great balancing principles of
variation and heredity come into operation. The
variety of patterns is immense, and for aught we know
new ones may be being evolved at the present time.
Here again, heredity comes in, for there is certainly some
tendency to repeat in a quite general way the pattern
of sire in the hands and feet of son. I have as yet found
no quite close correspondence of detail in any case
brought under my own notice. The question of identifying
a person on one or two lineations involves so many
practical problems of obscurity in printing and the like,
that it is more appropriate for discussion in another
chapter.</p>

<p>In a work published last year on <i>Science and the
Criminal</i>, by Mr. C. Ainsworth Mitchell, after quoting a
reference I made on one occasion to the influence of
heredity in <i>sometimes</i> dominating finger-patterns, the
author goes on to say: “While there is questionably a<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
general tendency for a particular type of finger-prints to
be inherited just as any other bodily peculiarities are
liable to be passed on from the parents to the children,
there is by no means that definite relationship that Dr.
Faulds hoped to establish.” The full passage in my
paper in <i>Nature</i> referred to, was <span class="nowrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The dominancy of heredity through these infinite
varieties is sometimes very striking. I have found
unique patterns in a parent repeated with marvellous
accuracy in his child. Negative results, however,
might prove nothing in regard to parentage, a caution
which it is important to make.”</p></div>

<p>The truth is, I have very frequently emphasized the
fact that in such similar patterns in sire and son there is
no real danger of false identification where several fingers
are compared in their proper serial order. It is not even
likely that two such fingers would agree exactly in
lineations, number, curvature, etc., if carefully measured
in the way set forth in this work.</p>

<p>A more remarkable criticism is to be found in p.&nbsp;63,
thus: “The existence of racial peculiarities in finger-prints,
which Dr. Faulds believed that he had discovered
in the case of the Japanese, has not been borne out by the
experience of others.” The author then mentions some
observations on this point by Galton, who thought that
“the width of the ridges appeared to be more uniform
and their direction more parallel in the finger-prints of
negroes than in those of other races.” The word
“negroes” here is delightfully vague in an ethnological
discussion. I have written nothing to justify the above
remark. My belief has long been that there is <i>no</i> racial
difference of yellow, white, red, or black, to use the good
old Egyptian classification, but that the human family<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
is one, and that view (right or wrong) was enunciated
often by me in Japan, both by speech and pen. Mr.
Mitchell’s strange misconception must surely be based
on my words in the article by me quoted above, where,
after enumerating some elements in patterns from different
races, I go on distinctly to say: “These instances
are not intended to stand for typical patterns of the two
peoples, but simply as illustrations of the kind of facts
to be observed.”</p>

<p>I had pleasure in giving my subscription and support
to the recent First Universal Races Congress, which has
done much, I believe, to consolidate scientific opinion as
to the essential unity of our kind, a belief not so old or
universal as many think, dating, indeed, not much more
than a century back, if so far, as a scientific opinion,
not biassed by the slave interest.</p>

<p>Of much more importance now is the relation to
human beings to the great anthropoid stocks.</p>

<p>It is usual to separate the lemurs, which have strong
affinities to monkeys and to men, from the anthropoids,
or man-like apes, forming two great orders of</p>

<p class="ml5em">
<i>Lemuroidea</i>, and<br />
<i>Anthropoidea</i>.
</p>

<p>In 1909, however, a paper was published by the Zoological
Society of London, in which this separation is
considered to be no longer justifiable, so that the lemurs
and big man-like apes (orang, chimpanzee, and gorilla)
would no longer be held as separate orders or sub-orders.
There were some who hoped to show that the races of
men corresponded to three primitive anthropoid stocks,
linked to the three kinds of anthropoid apes. Whether
the new view be correct or not, and there is something<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
to be said in its favour, there can be no reasonable doubt
now as to the close affinity which those creatures have
to ourselves and to one another.</p>

<p>When we first encounter remains of man or his close
predecessor in the records of the rocks, he was a dweller
in holes and caves of the earth. He certainly did not
make pots of any kind, or at least he has left no such
remains. Probably he had no such companions even as
the domestic dog or cat, no cattle, not at first any kind of
grain crop. He lived on roots and fruits, hunted, and
fished. Those early people have often been called
Troglodytes, from the Greek τρώγλη, a cave.</p>

<p>Professor Keith, the learned curator of the museum
of the Royal College of Surgeons, has advanced the theory
that about the middle of the Miocene Age a group of
creatures existed, having affinities to man as he now is,
which group the professor names Proto-troglodytes.
From these sprung three classes of Troglodytes, namely:</p>

<p class="ml5em">
The Gorilla;<br />
The Chimpanzee;<br />
Man.
</p>

<p>Some eighty-seven anatomical features are said to be
possessed by the gorilla in common with man only,
while the chimpanzee has ninety-eight such features as
belong to man. The gorilla has the best and biggest
teeth, and in this respect progressive deterioration went
on through the orang-utan and the chimpanzee to man.
According to the estimate of Professor Keith, there are
not in the whole world, at present, more than 100,000
chimpanzee, and some 10,000 gorillas.</p>

<p>The subject of twins is likely in future to be very
interesting in relation to the resemblance of their finger-<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>patterns.
The distinction is now made of twins proceeding
from one zygote or fertilized ovum, and twins
proceeding each from different fertilized ova. In the
first case, it is supposed that the twins are necessarily
of the same sex, while in the other, each twin child may
be of the sex determined by the fertilized ovum from
which it sprung. Clearly, in the latter case it might
often happen that both twins might be male, or both
female.</p>

<p>Dr. Berry Hart quotes from the records of another
observer (Wilder) in which there was a pair of “identical”
twins, in whom the similarity was complete even to the
finger-prints. [<i>Brit. Med. Jour.</i>, July 29th, 1911, p.&nbsp;215.]
I have found in the same family male and female with
<i>resembling</i> finger-prints, but none which could be called
identical, but opportunities of comparing twins of the
same sex do not often occur. While writing this chapter
I examined twins of the same sex (female). Their
finger-prints are very similar, but details diverge in
many directions. The matter merits close attention.
But how are we to determine that twins of the same
sex are from one ovum, seeing that there might be a
coincidence of twins of the same sex proceeding from
separate ova? If their finger-prints are “identical,”
is that the main evidence? or do identity of features,
colour of hair, voice, manners, and character, come up
independently? If one questions the theory, the
“identity” must be very complete indeed, to give
it vraisemblance, for how often do we not find that
children of the same parents, not twins, but born with
many years intervening, show most striking resemblance?
The alleged complete identity of finger-patterns, however,<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
is a most interesting and novel point, and ought to
receive close attention from parents and physicians.
A curious fact about hereditary resemblance is this,
which I have frequently observed. A child resembles,
say, a mother as a rule, but at some emotional, angry, or
vexed moment, lines are marked in the face by muscular
movements which bring out like a mask a striking
likeness, say, of the father, or of some other progenitor.
Besides this, a child at different stages may resemble
in succession different near relatives, and in a very striking
degree resemble them. But with regard to finger-patterns
there is no such variability. Even a month
or two before a child is born its little heraldic crest
begins to be firmly fixed for each finger, as it is to be
throughout life.</p>

<p>The disease called Acromegaly, or giant growth, involves
great expansion of the ridges and furrows, but
no case of actual change of patterns has been observed
as yet. The attention of medical men should be
given to this affection in regard to modification of linear
arrangement.</p>

<p>The likeness or divergence of finger-patterns in neighbouring
supernumerary fingers and toes might yield
interesting results if carefully recorded. Extra fingers
are commoner than extra toes. The webbing of fingers,
as in the chimpanzee, might also be noticed, and any
association with retrograde patterns, in the fingers
concerned.</p>

<p>The rapid growth of a literature of Criminology is
partly the result of better methods of identification.
It is unscientific to reason about the personal peculiarities
of all the Toms, Dicks, and Harrys, when Tom may be<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
Dick, or Dick Harry under a different alias. The
criminologist can now use his prison statistics as to age,
habits, and the like, with much greater confidence and
precision. In an interesting, but somewhat reckless
work on “Criminal Man,” which summarizes the teaching
of the eminent Italian authority on the anatomy
and psychology of the criminal&mdash;of the Italian criminal
at least&mdash;Cesare Lombroso, we are told (p.&nbsp;20):
“Long fingers are common to swindlers, thieves,
sexual offenders, and pickpockets. The lines on the
palmar surfaces of the finger-tips are often of a simple
nature, as in the anthropoids.” But they are not,
necessarily, of a simple nature in the anthropoids, but
often highly ornate and complex in their ramifications.
In the lower monkeys they are much simpler, and Sir
F. Galton thought it was so sometimes in the negro
peoples. Indeed, one is not surprised to meet such
simple lineation patterns now and again in cultivated
people, without any criminal taint, or negro blood, or
any anti-socialistic tendencies that can be easily detected.
A cautious prison doctor in Glasgow, Dr. Devon, has
written a clever book which gives much food for sober
reflection. He seems to say that the criminal is not a
kind of species by himself: “If those who come to prison
for the first time were made the subject of examination,
it would be found that they are principally remarkable
for the absence of what the books call criminal characteristics.”

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>TECHNIQUE OF PRINTING AND SCRUTINIZING
FINGER-PATTERNS</h3>


<p>There are important points connected, with the printing
of finger-patterns, especially for legal investigation,
which come now to be considered. A human finger, as
we have seen, is not, for printing purposes, just like a
lithographic stone, a box-wood engraving, or a plate
of zinc, steel, or copper. In ordinary printing, especially
of high-class and delicate engravings, the quality and
fluency of ink, the smoothness of surface and hygrometric
conditions of paper&mdash;due sometimes to local
atmosphere, and sometimes to climate generally&mdash;the
skill of workmen, all the conditions co-operate in producing
variations, slight it may be, but noticeable
in the results obtained. In the case of finger-prints
we might also have to consider the willingness or unwillingness
of the subject having his finger-prints
officially taken. A finger&mdash;even that of a dead person&mdash;is
compressible, while retaining on the whole the
pattern of its furrows and ridges, and hence under fairly
similar conditions, the printed products may be somewhat
different in appearance. The same fact would
apply, no doubt, also to impressions taken from an
indiarubber stamp, made, we shall suppose, for stamping
purposes in regard to documents, in imitation of a
particular finger-print pattern. Greater compression
tends to flatten out the ridges and to narrow the intervening
grooves, while it may also tend, especially when<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
associated with over-inking, to obliterate some of the
characteristic ramifications of the pattern. But, again,
the finger of a living person is usually in a state of physiological
activity. It swells or shrinks, drying up or
exuding moisture from its many pores, which facts,
however minute and insignificant they may appear
to the uninstructed, to the trained dactylographer they
leave a most interesting and significant record behind.</p>

<p>Examine carefully a ridge which has been printed&mdash;and,
if possible, photographically enlarged&mdash;at various
periods not long apart, and the pores with which it is
dotted will be found, while retaining their relative
positions, to vary somewhat in their degree of patency.
A single ridge might be compared to a naval cruiser,
the numerous funnels of which are not all belching forth
smoke at the same time, but one is almost smokeless
while its neighbour is quite active. Those pores which
have been copiously emitting sweat are seen, when imprinted,
to be larger than those that were inactive. An
imaginary case was once suggested to me as a final blow
to finger-print identification. A certain Mr. William
Sykes is officially known to be recruiting his valuable
health at one of His Majesty’s sanatoriums for people of
his profession. That celebrated artist’s “thumb”-print,
however, has been found liberally spotted all over the
scene of some tragic area of crime. What is to be said?
Well, the prodigality of display of the well-known sign-manual,
in circumstances when gloves are almost
invariably now worn by experts, might well arouse
suspicion in itself, but it would easily be found in such
a case that the pattern had been prodigally repeated
with too great fidelity in the matter of sweat-pores,<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
which, in the case of an active burglar, who is a sober,
hard-working fellow in spite of his faults, would vary
with each successive imprint, in a way that no manufacturer
of bogus “thumb”-prints could easily follow.</p>

<p>The fact that a finger&mdash;a clean finger&mdash;is naturally,
to some slight extent, greasy, partly from sebaceous
secretion, enables the expert dactylographer by various
chemical and mechanical means to obtain a pretty
clear vision, even in minute detail, of what before
had been quite invisible. A mere accidental smudge
from a slightly oily palm or finger, if imprinted
on glass, japanned tin, varnished or polished
wood, etc., may have its invisible lineations brought
out by dusting gently upon it some light powder
of appropriate colour. Dr. René Forgeot, in 1891,
first called attention to this method of bringing out
latent imprints, and my friend, Dr. Garson, of this
country, gave it further developments.</p>

<p>In my <i>Guide</i> I have mentioned some of my own results
with modifications of these methods.</p>

<p>On a pane of glass which a malign finger is suspected
to have touched, a fine black powder gives vivid and
beautiful results, the sooty matter clinging to and revealing
the oily surface of the lineations in very full
detail. In my article in <i>Nature</i> of 1880 a sooty imprint
is shown to have helped an innocent man to establish
his innocence, but in this case the imprint was quite
direct. The powder should be gently blown over, or
dusted lightly on to the greasy impression, with a soft
camel hair brush which is perfectly clean and dry.
Care should be taken not to breathe on the glass, or a
damp, smeary effect may result. I have not found<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
sable brushes act so well as those made of camel hair,
a fact which their structure under the microscope helps
to explain. (See <a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a>.)</p>

<p>The best treatment of a greasy smudge on a dark
ground, say the surface of a japanned cash-box, marble
slab, school slate, or enamelled door panel, is carefully
to dust over the object with a fine white powder, such as
the ordinary tooth-powder of the chemists, or still better,
as I find, with the light carbonate of magnesia. In one
sense this may be said to yield a <i>negative</i> print, but an
important qualification arises. The patterns now in
white are the ridges which before were black, while the
furrows remain dark as at first. In a smoked glass
print the white ridges have not imparted something to
the glass, but have simply removed the carbonaceous
deposit previously there. Practically, however, the
whitened ridges have the quality of a negative imprint,
as previously described<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></span></p>

<p>Greasy finger-marks may also be acted on chemically,
so as to bring out details by the application of osmic
acid. If there is any olein or oleic acid in the mark,
as there generally is in human finger-marks, the acid
deepens the tone of the almost invisible lines into a
brownish hue, revealing all their richness of detail. I
have succeeded in etching finger-marks of this kind on
glass by means of hydro-fluoric acid. They remain
quite indelible in all their details so long as the glass
itself endures. The patterns thus etched can be very
well brought into view by painting a dark background
on the reverse, or pasting dark paper behind. There
is a clear layer of the skin in both palms and soles, the<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
fat of which is eleidin. That particular kind of fat does
not stain with osmic acid in the usual way. The sweat
of palms and soles is not supposed to contain any fat
at all, but there would seem to be some faint trace of it
in sweat. The greasy surface of the skin as a rule comes
from the sebaceous glands, as previously described.
When clean palms leave a greasy smear, as they often
do, I think the greasiness must generally come by
transmission from other parts of the body, or from contact
with foreign greasy substances, which are common
enough.</p>

<p>For those who wish to study dactylography, the
apparatus is neither complicated nor expensive. A good
pair of compasses, a botanical lens, a school slate or
tin plate or porcelain tile, a small pot of fine printer’s
ink, and an ink-roller or photographer’s “squeegee”
will suffice for most purposes. For the expert who must
make fine measurements of enlarged photographs, and
perhaps defend them under keen forensic criticism,
one or two instruments are required, presently to be
described.</p>

<p>The ink may be daubed evenly and thinly on the
slate, tile or plate, but it is better to use a small printer’s
roller for the purpose. Avoid all fluff, hairs, or grit,
which thoroughly spoil any print. The roller should
always be scrupulously cleaned before laying aside, and
it is well to provide a tin case for its reception. The
remaining stock of ink should be carefully levelled a-top,
and covered with a drop or two of linseed or other oil,
which will preserve it in good and workable condition
for a long time. Reeve’s Artists’ Depôts, Ltd., 53
Moorgate Street, London, supply an excellent quality<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
of ink for this purpose, in flexible tubes, at sixpence
each, and the same firm can generally provide the rollers
or squeegees used by photographers, which serve very
well. In an emergency I have made serviceable ink
with burnt cork, lamp soot, even shoe-blacking, using a
good smooth and even cork as a roller. Wax casts,
which should occasionally be made for study, can be
made with the sheets of wax used greatly, at one time,
for the making of artificial flowers. Excellent casts
can also be made with putty, gutta-percha, sealing-wax,
or hard paraffin, such as is used to encase the modern
candle. Very excellent imprints of this kind have been
left by burglars on candles they have used.</p>

<p>Some useful practical hints as to how finger-prints
may be photographed and enlarged for police purposes
are supplied by Inspectors Stedman and Collins, in an
official work by Sir E.&nbsp;R. Henry, <i>Classification and Uses
of Finger-Prints</i>; and others occur in <i>Daktyloskopie</i>,
published in Vienna. Finger-marks on plated articles,
when placed squarely with the camera in a strong side
light, will appear light on a dark ground. The instructions
in such a case are: “Focus sharply. Should,
however, the mark be too faint to be clearly seen on the
focussing screen, a piece of printed paper can be placed
around the mark to focus by, but this should be removed
before exposing the plate, otherwise halation will set in
and obscure some of the lines in the finger-mark.” The
plate done in this way gives a negative result, so that a
transparency must be made and used so as to convert
that into a positive print.</p>

<p>The fingers and thumbs may each be printed separately.
For identification the serial order of fingers must be<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
retained on the record. The official method in England
is to print four fingers of each hand simultaneously,
adding the right and left thumb to each respective
section of the register. In addition, each thumb and
finger is imprinted by rolling it slightly, which gives an
enlarged area for the display of the more important
linear elements in each finger pattern.</p>

<p>The prisoner signs this sheet, and also adhibits an
imprint from his right forefinger under the signature.</p>

<p>The highly-glazed papers now so much used for half-tone
photographic reproductions are not, in my experience,
particularly good for ordinary impressions.
The surface of any paper used should be fairly smooth,
the texture firm, tough (not brittle), durable, and the
colour white, as photographs for enlargement as judicial
exhibits may be required.</p>

<p>Great care is now taken officially to secure the correct
order of fingers, as on that the validity of the method
depends, and the whole utility of the classification.</p>

<p>Inspectors Stedman and Collins, in the work just
quoted, state that when finger-prints are required to be
produced as evidence in a court of justice, “they are
first enlarged 5 diameters direct with an enlarging
camera. The negatives are afterwards placed in an
electric light enlarging lantern, with which it is possible
to obtain a photographic enlargement of a finger-print
36 inches square, such a photograph being as large as is
ever likely to be required.”</p>

<p>In my <i>Guide to Finger-Print Identification</i> (p.&nbsp;62) I
have advocated uniform enlargement of all such exhibits
on the decimal or metric system, and hope that international
agreement on this point may be secured. Apart<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
from criminal services its scientific utility would ultimately
be very great. The objection that an English
jury would dislike being confronted with the technicalities
of a foreign and “mathematical” system is very
easily met. An English jury&mdash;and no jury in the world
is fairer or clearer-headed&mdash;would only, in any case, have
to compare two figures <i>similarly enlarged</i>, one being that
of the accused person’s fingers, taken while in custody,
and the other, either a similar official record of another
date, or a smudgy mark from some blotting-pad,
window-pane, drinking-glass, bottle, or the like. The
two exhibits, paired for comparison, would have been
enlarged exactly on the same scale, whatever that scale
might have been. For purposes of judicial comparison,
therefore, English terms and English instruments
might be used throughout, and no inconvenience could
be felt by the most insularly prejudiced jury that could
possibly be got together.</p>

<p>When a photographic enlargement has been made,
it is necessary to be able readily to test its conformity
with the enlargement to be compared with it, or if there
be not strict agreement, to allow for and calculate the
admitted discrepancy. This may easily be done by
an application of the “rule of three.”</p>

</div>

<p>It may be necessary to test the concurrence of curved lines in two
exhibits similarly enlarged. At one time I used strips of plumber’s
lead, placed edgeways on the curved lines to be compared. They could
be flexed so as to show the various sinuosities, however complex,
but leaden tapes cannot readily be made to retain the form imparted
to them. Copper wire I found to be stiffer, but it readily warps off
the plane. An excellent way is<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
to draw on transparent paper a line corresponding to the curved line
seen underneath. The transparency is then transferred and adjusted
to the other enlargement, the curves of which should be seen to be
congruent. The instrument called “flexible curves” which is used
by engineers and mechanical draughtsmen I at last tried, and found
it to be exceedingly serviceable for such comparisons. The pattern
“<span class="font">B</span>,” self-clamping, 12-inch size, is for most cases the most
suitable. Other patterns are made also, in sizes of 9 and 18 inches.
The “<span class="font">B</span>” pattern has a flexible steel strip, like the lead
tape just mentioned. After the curve or series of sinuosities has
been adjusted correctly, the shape is rigidly retained by means of
a stiff-hinged link-work arrangement attached by tabs. The strip
of steel should not be pressed down between two tabs, and when
bending or straightening out the<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
instrument one should do so bit
by bit, beginning at one end and continuing onwards from there. This
useful self-clamping instrument used to be supplied by Mr. Wm. Brooks,
scientific instrument maker, 33 Fitzroy Street, Tottenham Court Road,
London. Another instrument of this kind, the “Curve Rule” is sold by
Mr. W. Harling, 47 Finsbury Pavement, E.C., and is figured here.</p>

<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Harling’s J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;B. Curve Rules.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In dealing with such <i>approximate</i> curves as one finds
among the lineations of finger-prints, one is not supposed
to apply strictly mathematical principles. The
lines, for example, have breadth, but not quite invariable
breadth. We must, therefore, avoid treating them,
as a beginner fresh from the schools is apt to do, as ideal
concepts. The simpler terms, however, as used by a
teacher of drawing, with the provisos already hinted at,
will serve very well to guide one’s efforts, or to explain
one’s own conceptions before a magistrate or a jury.</p>

<p>Besides the congruity of the curves, one has further
to test the single lineations, their junctions, number,
and character. An excellent way to envisage these is
to make alternate linings with blue and red pencil, to
represent them as they seem. To do this effectively
one may single out a special measured square, or circle,
or parallelogram, of the enlarged figure. Proceed then,
quite ignoring, if need be, all great curvatures, to consider
the lines as simple curved or straight lines, and
analyse them into composing elements, like twigs of a
tree or the characteristics of a runic alphabet. The
result will be, perhaps, like the figure on the next page.</p>

<p>It will now be quite easy to orient, or place correctly
in space, the corresponding part of the other print&mdash;if
it really does correspond&mdash;and a similar <span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>“rune”
should result. One may afterwards follow out each
recognized lineation into further complexities or joinings,
as you might trace out a railway line with its various
junctions in a map.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/071.jpg" width="380" height="133" alt="" />
<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Diagrammatic Analysis of Lineations in a

</div>

<p>A photographic enlargement, meant for forensic use,
ought not to be marked or soiled in any way, but dots
of coloured chalk or ink might be placed along the margins
to denote where imaginary ruled lines might begin
or end. One might also use glazed tissue paper, ruled
in squares, or with eccentric circles like the mileage lines
in a map of London. By the use of these placed over
the figure one might verify particular coincidences
or demonstrate discrepancies.</p>

<p>When the skin-pattern is impressed upon soft sealing-wax,
clay, putty, and so on, the <i>relievo</i> image produced
is different in this way from an ordinary ink-printed
pattern. The convex ridges are now concave furrows,
while the hollows are changed into heights.</p>

<p>In both kinds of impressions a reverse or <i>mirror</i>
pattern is produced, a matter of some practical importance.
This effect may, or may not again be reversed
in the photographic process. It is not impossible, in
such circumstances, that a suspect’s finger might be
confused with a resembling “mirror” pattern, which
was really not his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span></p>

<p>I have thought that the word <i>verso</i>, used technically
for the reverse of a coin or medal, might be usefully
employed in dactylography for the reverse or mirror
image of a finger-pattern when printed. A technical
word for the indented impression made by a finger on
wax and the like is also wanted. Now geologists use
<i>-lite</i> as a terminal to express the impression or cavity
which had been formed in a rock, when soft, by the
impressed body of an organism. Hence the word
<i>dactylolite</i> might be used to denote an indented impression
of a finger.</p>

<img src="images/072.jpg" width="430" height="276" alt="" />
<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Kew Micrometer.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In making measurements of exhibits, the Kew
micrometer devised by Sir Joseph Hooker is of much
service. It is figured here, and has the useful quality of
rendering measurements at the same time in both the
English and decimal systems.</p>

<p>For the method of encircling suspect smudges, either
before or after enlargement, and measuring from one<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
fixed centre by the Kew micrometer or ordinary compasses,
I have devised a disc of glass such as is used in
microscope slides, and about the size of half-a-crown.
In the centre is a conical pit into which one leg of the
compass rests. Precise centring is thus obtained without
the slightest risk of damaging the photographic or other
exhibit by the sharp point of the compasses, which have,
at the same time, free swing. These were prepared for
me by Mr. Franks, optician, Stoke-on-Trent, and cost
very little.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/073.jpg" width="370" height="235" alt="" />
<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Glass Disc Centred</span> (enlarged).</p></div>
</div>

<p>In all measurements close to a fork or junction, as
in the crook of the letter <span class="font">Y</span>, care must be taken in
counting the lines below or above the fork. Ambiguity
readily arises, with a train of resulting discrepancies.
Other ambiguities also occur which require mention in
a word or two. In deciphering an ancient manuscript
blurred, mouldy, mayhap worm-eaten, doubts may
arise as to which of two or three possible words or letters
may have been intended. One looks for some rationality
in the author’s writing, but in finger-prints there can be<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
no such help. In manuscripts the problem may not
directly be as to a word, but only as to a letter, but that
single letter, read differently, may change the tenor of a
passage. Is <img src="images/c.jpg" width="13" height="14" alt="fragmented letter C" /> to be read as <span class="font">C</span> or as <span class="font">G</span> or as <span class="font">O</span>? Is <img src="images/e.jpg" width="13" height="14" alt="fragmented letter E" /> to
be read as <span class="font">E</span> or as <span class="font">B</span>? So Fork is liable to be read
as Pork.</p>

<p>Now, a very similar difficulty frequently occurs in
reading a blurred finger-print, and such evidence should
be scrutinized with the greatest vigilance, and all really
doubtful cases should be discarded as useless in evidence.
While the obscurity is sometimes merely due to defective
printing, there are several patterns of frequent occurrence
which are liable to be read variably. This was discussed
at some length in chapter iii. of the <i>Guide</i>. There is
a tendency so to view blots or blurs in such a case, that
the cloudy spots become a weasel or even a whale. In
Japan there are artists’ wine-parties, where a common
game is to make an accidental splash of ink or colour,
which is passed on to the next guest, who in turn converts
it by one or more strokes of the brush into a figure
of some character. Some years ago, I gave to a young
men’s meeting a lecture on Ghosts, in which I showed
a collection of ink-splashes produced without design,
some of which were quite strikingly artistic in their suggestive
impressionism. Hence the importance of clear
printing, vigilant scrutiny of exhibits to be compared,
and the attention of a well-informed judge and
intelligent jury.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, when a suspected person
has been arrested abroad or at a distance, it may be
desirable to compare his fresh finger-prints broadly
with that of some well-known criminal whose register<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
has been long in the hands of the police. This want
led me to suggest, in 1905, that photo-telegraphy, in
one of its forms, might be brought into use. Many
improvements have been made since then, and it is
now, I think, quite feasible to secure and transmit to a
great distance outline lineations quite good enough for
use at a preliminary enquiry, previous to a remand or
committal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>PERSISTENCE OF PATTERNS</h3>


<p>A human finger, in ordinary circumstances, may preserve,
unimpaired, not only its general pattern of lineations,
sometimes very intricate, during its owner’s
lifetime, but the minutest details also may be discerned
after thirty or forty years, quite unchanged as elements
of a pattern, and very likely for a longer period, though
scientific observation has not extended much beyond that
limit. Long immersion, after death, in water, till the
skin is quite sodden, does not readily destroy, does not
even greatly obscure, the lineations for the purpose of
comparison with earlier printed records of them, and one
can still read into finger-print type, so to speak, the
lineations of an Egyptian mummy.</p>

<p>When first I ventured to call the attention of the
scientific world to the patterns of finger-prints in 1879
or 1880, I suggested that the ancient mummies of Egypt
might possibly be found to have retained those features
sufficiently to be studied. I had no opportunity of
obtaining access to such remains in order to test the point,
but on returning to England I found that anticipation
to be amply justified, as anyone may verify by a visit
to the British Museum. The skin of a mummy is
contracted, hard, and wrinkled, but one may trace the
lineations through all their loops, joinings, ramifications
and whorls, with great distinctness. So that it follows,
did an Egyptian register of finger-prints exist, we might<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
unearth the names and titles or deeds of some of those
men who lived several thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>There is nothing, so far as has yet been observed, to
mark their race out as essentially different from our
own, nor do any ancient finger-prints look unlike those
of present-day people’s.</p>

<p>The ridges on toes and fingers are visible in children
born prematurely, even at a very early period, as I have
observed in the practice of my profession, and as soon
as the lineations are at all discernible they are of human
type. So far as has yet been observed, we do not find
that the growing human embryo repeats a history of
finger-patterns, beginning at an earlier and lowlier
biological stage, as is sometimes contended to be the
case in regard to some other organic structures undergoing
development.</p>

<p>The efforts I first made to investigate the problem of
permanence were chiefly directed to the earlier periods
of life, as presenting the greatest likelihood of variation
in patterns during rapid growth. A large number of
Japanese children, and also some thirty-five or more
children of European parentage, in ages from five to ten,
were minutely examined time after time during a period
of two years&mdash;some of them again at longer intervals&mdash;without
a single variation being detected. The lines and
patterns in the fingers of growing children broaden out
as the infant grows, but the ideal form&mdash;so to speak&mdash;of
the pattern itself, retains full sway. To grasp this
conception clearly is almost the whole science of finger-print
identification.</p>

<p>During that period, some of those children suffered
severely from scarlet fever, which, as a new disease,<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
took a severe form in Japan, and the desquamation, or
skin-peeling, was unusually severe, so that in those cases
the test was a severe one. On several occasions I have
called attention to the possibility of severe desquamation
being followed by some change of patterns,
and I still think this subject merits the attention of
medical men, but no actual fact illustrating the apparent
danger has yet been brought under notice. This may,
however, be simply the result of a high degree of inattention
to a subject which medical men do not seem
to have interested themselves in until very recently.
In acromegaly, a disease in which the fingers take on
gigantic features, one might expect to find a very notable
change of patterns, perhaps the addition of fresh lineations,
but after some attempts to collect information
not one single example of the kind has yet reached me.</p>

<p>Besides testing growing children in the manner I have
stated, many Japanese medical students between the
ages of twenty and thirty were made use of in this way.
The ridges were carefully shaved by razors, or smoothed
away by sand-paper, emery dust, or pumice stone, so
that no distinct patterns could be traced. The same
tests were applied to my own fingers and to those of one
or two medical friends who were quite sceptical as to the
continuity of the patterns. Many of the patients at the
hospital, or out-door dispensary, were also induced to
submit, but not a single instance of variation in the
patterns was ever brought to light. My own fingerprints
have not varied since that date, a period of fully
thirty years. However smooth the surface had been
made, the old design came up again with perfect fidelity,
yielding exactly the same imprints as before, subject<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
only to those very minor variations already described in
a previous chapter, to which even engravings are
subject. Up to the period of my final return to England
in 1887, a period of nearly nine years, enthusiastic and
vigilant observation of this point gave me complete
confidence in the permanence of finger-print patterns
as a basis of personal identification. With the exception
of acromegaly and skin-peeling after acute fevers, I can
conceive of no biological reason why changes might be
anticipated in those patterns, and up to the present
no evidence has reached me that even those conditions
do effect pattern changes. In old age the ridges shrink
somewhat, and wrinkles here and there betray the drying
up of tissues, which facts are revealed in printed impressions
by fine white lines, often cutting across the
lineations, not unlike those which occur in box-wood
engravings, where hair-like lines betray some cleavage
of the wood. In such a case the value of the pattern is
not affected as a proof of identity. One may go beyond
that, and say that, if after a lapse of forty years or so
the old pattern is now crossed by wrinkles which were
not there in youth, the two prints are from the same
individual.</p>

<p>Other observers&mdash;Sir Francis Galton, Sir William
Herschel, and the police of this and other countries&mdash;have
accumulated a vast store of conclusive evidence
on this point.</p>

<p>We are now amply justified in assuming that, for all
practical purposes of identification, the patterns on
human fingers are, throughout life, persistent and unchangeable.
Such slight and transient changes&mdash;not
due to mere variations of pressure, inking, and the like,<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
as they usually are&mdash;are no more likely to invalidate
an identification than a new freckle or pimple on a man’s
face would make him unrecognizable by his intimate
friends.</p>

<p>Dr. J.&nbsp;G. Garson, in an article in the <i>Daily Express</i>
of July 20th, 1905, writing on this subject, which he has
carefully studied, <span class="nowrap">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is now a well ascertained fact that every person
bears on his fingers as certain proof of his identity as
he does on his face. The latter is, however, that part
of his anatomy by which he is most readily identified
by the world at large, though to his intimate friends
other particulars about him may characterise him
equally strongly. By means of the eye, the <i>tout
ensemble</i> of the countenance is registered upon the
mind, generally regardless of details respecting the
actual form of each particular feature&mdash;in short, a
person is recognized and identified by exactly the same
psychological process as a printed or written word is
read without first spelling it.”</p></div>

<p>It must be clear to any student of the subject that
<i>persistence of patterns</i> must become the basis of identification
in this way, and that persistence is now as firmly
established as anything can be as to living creatures.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Henry, in his <i>Finger-Prints</i>, says (p.&nbsp;17,
3rd edition): “Impressions being required for permanent
record, their utility must, in great measure, be contingent
upon the persistence through long periods of
time, of the general form of the pattern and of the details
of the ridges constituting it.” No such stability has
yet been shown to exist in regard to any other part of
the body. The bones change very greatly, not only in
size, but in shape, texture, and mechanical conditions
through life. Even the ordinary features and expression
of a human being by no means can be said to remain<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
uniform. One sees a friend during many short intervals,
and is not finely observant of minute changes that in a
decade or two amount collectively to an almost complete
transformation of the man’s whole face and figure. The
photographic system of identification, although serving
a purpose now and then, was found, therefore, to be
untrustworthy.</p>

<p>My revered teacher, Lord Lister, noted the slow
migrations of the pigmentary particles that make the
web-like patterns on a frog’s foot. I have observed
similar but still slower changes in ordinary freckles on a
human hand. The white spots of leucoderma&mdash;a skin-disease
that used to be confused with leprosy, from
which it entirely differs&mdash;are often bounded with dark
borders, into which the pigment particles have migrated
from the white spots. A negro’s skin sometimes becomes
white where a fly-blister has been applied, as a fair-skinned
person is often marked with a dark patch after a
similar application. The pigment particles move to and
fro like living things, though very slowly, and the marks
they collectively make on a living body are not fixed
and stable. Again, we have seen that the police used to
record the position of wens, tumours, tattoo marks and
the like. But tumours are now often removed through
the line of natural creases, or wrinkles, leaving very faint
traces, if any, behind.</p>

<p>An official in Japan had a large wen on his forehead,
which disfigured him greatly. He was getting elderly,
and told me, when friends brought him, that he would as
soon have the wen as a scar. I got him to consent to
have it removed through the natural wrinkle in the forehead,
after which it left no visible trace at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span></p>

<p>A curious case was that of a man whose back and
shoulders were adorned by a large collection of a certain
kind of tumour varying from the size of a chestnut to that
of a hen’s egg. They all disappeared, without the use
of the knife, leaving no scar behind, and only a slight
lowering and thinning of the skin.</p>

<p>Even scars, themselves, sometimes very unsightly
ones, tone away to a large extent, till they cease to be at
all conspicuous. The colour of the hair changes greatly
in some people at the various stages of life. Certain
diseases, too, such as malarious affections, the action of
the sun, and certain employments, change the complexion
in a very remarkable way.</p>

<p>What the pole-star used to be in navigation, fingerprint
patterns are now become for all serious purposes
of practical identification.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE SYLLABIC CLASSIFICATION OF FINGER-PRINTS</h3>


<p>Having secured some technical knowledge of how to
print, and how to read old finger-prints correctly and
with confidence when they turn up again in experience,
we are faced now with the problem of how to classify
and arrange them for secure preservation and prompt
and easy reference, whatever may be our object.</p>

<p>In natural history, in biological facts generally, it is
not always easy to define the objects of study strictly,
so as to classify them in a practical way. Dealing,
however, with printed finger-patterns which are no
longer living and changing things, we can hope to secure
some of the advantages of a mechanical method. Verworn,
in his <i>General Physiology</i> (p.&nbsp;71) says, very justly:
“The fixing of sharp limits and definitions must contain,
finally, a more or less arbitrary element, [that], indeed,
all limits and definitions are only psychological helps
towards knowledge.” Bearing this principle in mind,
then, what is the end or object we aim at in a system of
finger-print classification?</p>

<p>The objects of identifying a person with some one who
has had a name and left a history are of various kinds,
as criminal, civil, military, naval, medical, legal, scientific,
and insurance purposes. Now, in regard to the use
of finger-prints for so many ends in view, a difficulty
presents itself. It occurred to me at the outset of my
studies, that if the system were to prove trustworthy<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
and useful, even in a minor degree, immense numbers
of people in civil life, in army, navy, and mercantile
services, or under criminal conviction, would require
to have their prints correctly classified, indexed, and
arranged for easy reference. How could it be possible
in so vast a collection or series of collections to find the
one single record wanted? To ransack&mdash;unaided by
a scientific method of classification&mdash;the register of an
army containing some 500,000 soldiers would involve
the search of a much larger number of cards or sheets
than 500,000, according to the duration of regular
service, and other possible conditions. To do this
would obviously be quite as hopeless and futile
a task as groping for a lost needle in a huge
hay-field. The problem was to find a system
which would facilitate the search in a <i>high degree</i>.
Any mere slight assistance would still leave the
essential problem unsolved. Now, we might have
found in finger-prints mere variety without persistence,
or mere persistence without initial variety, and in
either case the study could yield little practical
result. Again, mere diversity, however persistent,
without some elements of underlying resemblance,
would not have yielded a basis for such a methodic
arrangement as was obviously required.</p>

<p>Much aid came to me from the first, as I have already
hinted, from five years’ daily laborious experience in
sorting and comparing analogous but artificial patterns
in the now obsolete Paisley shawl trade, but in the case
now in view colour did not come in as an aid to
arrangement. This problem, moreover, was not one of
those the poet derides as of mere “gold or clay,” but<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
as I saw, it concerned itself with human lives, and
was a task, indeed, that might awaken in the dullest
mind a keen sense of moral responsibility in proposing
its general use as a new and quite trustworthy method of
criminal and other modes of identification. The expert
in charge might suddenly be called upon after a little
expansion of the system to prove the identity of some
evil-doer out of many thousands of possible persons, or to
subject a suspected person, on the evidence of a few
smudgy streaks of ink or blood, to life-long servitude,
or to the irremediable doom of a shameful death. In
my own case, at this early stage, the mere possibility of
a single serious false identification by a method as yet
untried became really terrible to contemplate. After
closer study, a clear path began to open through the
tangled jungle.</p>

<p>Some familiarity with the equipment of a Far-Eastern
printing-press had been afforded me while editing <i>The
Chrysanthemum</i>, a monthly magazine published in
Tokyo, and devoted to the discussion of Japanese topics
of literary, scientific, or antiquarian interest. There
were some hundreds of thousands of different forms of
type, all classified in so convenient a way that any
compositor, by running about a little more actively than
would be quite compatible with the grave dignity of an
English printing establishment, could soon find the
character in whatever form of fount he desired. The
idea suggested itself then, that analogous qualities as a
basis for classification of the finger-patterns might be
revealed by a closer study of Chinese. I do not know
Chinese&mdash;some years’ close study has convinced me of
that. However, each Chinese ideograph, for dictionary<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
purposes, is supposed to be built up around an element
called by western lexicographers its <i>key</i> or <i>radical</i>, and
of these there are two hundred and twelve. You look
for the radical in an unknown character, and then look
for that radical in its serial place in the two hundred
and twelve. It is a question then, as in finger-prints,
of counting strokes, and if the strokes are alike in number
in any two instances, of looking then as to how they are
arranged. Two characters with the same number of
pen-strokes under the same radical or key, may bear
quite a different aspect.</p>

<p>A Chinese character is defined and limited, but a
finger-print pattern often, or usually, trails off into indeterminate
lineations of little value for classification
purposes. Hence we seek in the latter to isolate for
study the central part of the pattern, where the intricacy
of the ramifications usually rises to a maximum. The
space covered by the lineations that matter is not usually
greater than, often not so wide as, the space occupied
by the head of the Sovereign on an English postage
stamp. Into this brief compass is compressed a world
of significance. A courteous and intelligent young
detective in Scotland Yard asked me (in 1886 or 1887,
when I was advocating the adoption of finger-print
identification), did I really propose to rest identification
on features contained within so small a space? I
answered him, in pointing to a railway map of London,
to consider a net-work of junctions which I indicated,
if he would not be justified in saying if that fragment,
torn away from its context, were presented to him, that it
was a portion of a map of London? After a little scrutiny,
he admitted that was so. I had no difficulty in<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
showing him then, that the condensed ramifications of a
single finger-print within the very limited area proposed
by me were much greater than that of the significant
portion of the London map I had just pointed out
to him.</p>

<p>In tracking a criminal by a single impression made by
a finger, the lineations in so small a space would require
to have been clearly imprinted, and to have what many
finger-print patterns have not, some notable or significant
characteristics about it. Then, when enlarged by photography
into a picture of some thirty inches, the measurements
from fixed points in the pattern should correspond
with those of the person in custody, on suspicion, and
the curves should be shown to concur in all their sinuosities.
But, in comparing two official imprints of the
ten fingers properly and clearly impressed, there should
be no difficulty, the points of comparison being overwhelming.</p>

<p>In a possible collection of half-a-million or a million
complete sets of finger-prints, can the one before me,
of one Thomas Atkins, John Doe, or Richard Roe&mdash;under
whatever alias&mdash;be promptly found if it is there,
or, if not there, can its absence be conclusively determined?
We have seen, I think, that if two such patterns
are confronted, common-sense, and the use of fine
measurements, will soon determine whether they be
of the same original, or different. The problem, then,
is to get this swift and sure confrontation effected.</p>

<p>This problem engaged my attention from the first, or
at least not many months after I first began to attend
to finger-patterns, and in 1880, when I proposed the
printing and recording of the ten fingers of old criminals,<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
I had thought out the same method now outlined in this
chapter. It would be impossible to compress all the
details necessary to work out the matter officially, without
producing a work as large, and perhaps as expensive, as
a Chinese dictionary, of which the probabilities are
that one or perhaps two copies might be sold.</p>

<p>I laid this matter in outline before Inspector Tunbridge,
in his official capacity, in 1888, and again before
the War Office Committee, at which an Under-Secretary
of the Home Office was present, taking diligent notes.
The system now in official use&mdash;an improvement made
by Sir Edward R. Henry upon Sir F. Galton’s very
premature attempt (after a few years’ study in old age)
seems to work practically, and therefore I have no
criticism to offer, further than to suggest, that if in our
system of mercantile book-keeping we had retained the
use of Roman numerals, fortunes might continue to be
made or lost. I cannot think, however, that our merchants
would now give up the Arabic notation for the
more complex and clumsy one of ancient Italy. Nor
is nature likely to resume her interest in the kangaroo
and its future.</p>

<p>Science seeks simplicity, and the <i>Syllabic system</i>, now
familiar to every one who uses a telegraphic code, is
what I proposed for finger-print registers. In this I
simply followed the method of transliterating Japanese
and Chinese words into syllables of the Roman alphabet,
a condition originally imposed by the old Japanese
language itself, in which consonants do not occur singly,
but are followed by vowels. Purkinje’s first analysis
of the finger-print patterns was not known to me, nor,
I believe, to anyone in Europe or America, when I first<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
wrote, although I often in those years suggested that
he had probably written something on the subject. My
first article in <i>Nature</i>, as sent up, contained a kind of
analysis of patterns, with many types, named as whorls,
ovals, deltas, loops, junctions, and the like. Some are
referred to in the text, but the editor expressed his
regret that he had not been able to insert the figures,
and their lack made the references in my article obscure.
We shall deal with a few of these elementary or typical
figures presently. But, let us now come to the main
aspect of the syllabic system, in contrast with that
devised by Sir F. Galton, who looked upon it as merely
ancillary to the anthropometric system of Mons. A.
Bertillon, of the French police. Galton was supremely
anxious to have his natural facts, his finger-print records,
arranged precisely in similar parcels, so that one would
not be excessively rich in records compared with its
neighbour. Now, what does it matter to the keeper of
records, or even to the tax-payer, whether one class of
patterns is big or little? The whole absurd complexity
arising now, and increasing from year to year, grows out
of this essential misapprehension from the first of the
vital problems of finger-print classification. Advancing
a stage for the moment, let us suppose that a rich register
exists, arranged on the syllabic system. A type-writer,
not necessarily a very intellectual creature, or a boy-clerk,
is in the room, and has the call to find <i>A-bra-ca-da-bra</i>.
I use here for convenience only five syllables,
representing one hand. The sheets or cards (sheets have
been found best by experience) are not separated in
bundles except as to a convenient size. It does not take
long to look along the shelves till <i>A-bra-</i> etc., is reached,<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
and then the cabalistic word itself. It may prove that
there are some ten sheets on the register under this
syllabic title. These are transmitted, all in a few
moments, to the expert keeper of the records. At a
glance an expert eye like his perceives that, perhaps,
seven out of the ten can have no possible relation to the
case now being enquired into. Of the three, one is
perhaps now in prison and cannot be the suspect. Of
the two remaining forms, the details of the first two
fingers compared may diverge completely in many ways,
as determined by counting lines, measuring curves, and
so on. I am sure this would be no fancy description,
from the many tests I have applied. The whole strain of
the recognition lies on the expert, as the strain of the
primary classification of records had lain upon him
at the time they were being made. Of course, more
than one expert might be needed.</p>

<p>It will be noticed, perhaps, that the syllable <i>bra</i>
occurs twice on the same hand register. It by no means
follows that the finger-print represented by the second
<i>bra</i> is very like that of the first one. In the same way,
none of the patterns indicated by <i>bra</i> in the cards of
similar syllabic index may much resemble the others,
even broadly. The pattern simply is of a certain typical
form with which <i>bra</i> is to be linked for registration
purposes. The same word, so to speak, might be
divided in a different syllabic way, <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="ml5em">
<i>Ab-ra-cad-ab-ra</i>;<br />
<i>Ab-rac-ad-ab-ra</i>; and so on.</p>

<p>Hence the necessity of separating the syllables by
hyphens.</p>

<p>The divergence of cards will be greater, of course, in<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
the case of a two-hand register, and even in one which
comprehended, say, one million of complete sets there
would be very few repetitions of the same arrangement
of syllables.</p>

<p>One great advantage of the syllabic form is the help
given to the memory in transferring the eye from one
sheet to others which may be wanted. In the system
now in use the symbols do not rivet themselves in the
same way, and have a monotony that becomes very
tiring.</p>

<p>A general view of the precise intention aimed at in the
particular register must determine the extensiveness
of the form the register is to compass. Are the numbers
likely to be large? Must the registers extend over long
periods? Are infants to be kept in view over adult life,
if that is reached? Many enquiries of this kind may
have to be met before the exact form of the cards or
sheets is determined. For such civil and social purposes
as life insurances, signatures of deeds, benefit of friendly
societies, and the like, a comparatively simple form of
register and limited number of finger imprints might be
all that would be required for an effective service. The
number of cards would not be very great, and the probabilities
of personation would likely be restricted to a
few local residents whose finger-prints would not often
be found even to approach coincidence in a slight degree.
To serve such needs, an elementary form of classification
would go a long way to overtake ordinary requirements,
and would be easy of reference. Few of the difficulties
involved in graver conditions of legal identification need
be raised as an objection to the general use in banking
and ordinary business of this new mode of identification.<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
In forming a system, even with a very wide range, the
whole amount of possible complexity in finger-patterns
need rarely be called upon, and could not conceivably
be exhausted. I speak confidently on this point. The
central part of the pattern used is generally very limited,
and its area may be widened whenever an enlargement
of the primary requirements may demand more complexity
in the factors of identification. The ramifications
will usually provide variety enough to satisfy the
most avaricious register.</p>

<p>Some of the main conditions on which the problem of
alphabetic arrangement of the index depends may now
be set forth, before we proceed to consider how those
conventional syllables are to be formed which indicate
patterns.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Distinction is not made between capital and lower-case
letters. Simple letters are too soon exhausted in a
register of any considerable size. It is obvious that
syllables give a much greater variety. As far as possible,
commensurate with the dimensions of the register, the
syllables should be kept few, simple, compact, and pronounceable.
The vowels have the Italian sound. No
syllables should contain more than four letters at the
utmost.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;When a doubt arises as to the proper syllabic
reading of a finger-pattern, the earlier letters of the
Roman alphabet have the precedence, thus <i>b</i> before <i>d</i>,
<i>l</i> before <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Where the core of a pattern seems to contain two
or more clusters of significant lineations, choose for the
index syllable that on the right side of the pattern, or,
if that is difficult to determine, next that which is highest<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
in position. In such a case, reference to orientation or
position refers to the usual or official pattern. In dealing
with a smudge of unknown origin, the various possibilities
may be tried, assuming relative order of position, as
above.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;When spaces or figures, such as ovals or circles, are
described as “<i>large</i>,” that means wider than the space
occupied by two average lineations in that finger-print.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;When a finger-pattern has been permanently
defaced or obliterated by injury or disease, the missing
mark may be denoted by an asterisk (*). If the finger
itself is missing, by deformity or mutilation, the
asterisk may be encircled with an <span class="font">O</span>. A special compartment
of the register might be kept for the reception
of all such cases.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;Badly-printed or obscure patterns should be
held in reserve under a special register classified according
to probabilities, aided by cross indexing, and receiving
special attention from the higher experts. Official
patterns badly printed should at once be repeated,
if possible, before confusion arises.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;Registers for naval or military, and banking,
insurance, and general purposes, should be kept strictly
free from any police supervision or control.</p>

<p>The syllables in my system, viewed as lexicographic
elements, consist of the ordinary Roman vowels and
consonants, the vowels being pronounced, as already
said, as in the Italian language. I hold in reserve for
additional official purposes a few additional characters,
such as the Greek letter <i>delta</i> Δ. Those, however,
need not be dealt with in the brief space now available,
and would only be required, I believe, in pretty extensive<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
registers. The functions of the conventionally fixed
vowels may be better understood after we have sampled
a few of the consonants.</p>

<p>As suggested to me by Sir Isaac Pitman’s system of
phonography, learned in student years, I arranged the
consonants in co-related pairs, thus: <i>p, b</i>; <i>t, d</i>; <i>s, z</i>;
<i>h, f</i>; <i>l, r</i>; <i>k, g</i>; <i>v, w</i>; <i>ch</i> (considered as a consonantal
character), <i>j</i>; <i>m, n</i>.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out, in dealing with problematic
smudges, the need of understanding patterns apart from
their actual orientation, which, in an unknown person’s
case, may have to be assumed, an attitude which may
be determined by official bias. This I have entered more
fully upon in the <i>Guide to Finger-Print Identification</i>.</p>

<p>Holding this principle in view, then, let us now take
some of the simpler elements of patterns in their very
simplest forms, and first consider those grouped under
the paired consonants.</p>

<p class="tac"><span class="font">Ch</span> and <span class="font">J</span>.</p>

<p>Each of these characters is taken to represent a hook
with a short leg. <span class="font">Ch</span> is considered as one consonant, and
as <span class="font">C</span> is not otherwise wanted, it might have been used
alone but for its pronunciation being indefinite. If in
the usual form of official imprint the hook, with its
curve below, has its short leg facing to the left, thus, <span class="font">J</span>,
it is duly represented by the Roman letter of that shape.
Observe that if you invert this character, or the type
which represents it, thus <img src="images/invj.jpg" width="11" height="14" alt="inverted letter J" />, it will still point the observer
to the <span class="font">J</span> part of the index, on getting the curve set right.</p>

<p>If the short leg of the figure points to the right it comes
under <span class="font">Ch</span>. If that happens to confront one in its inverted
position it cannot be mistaken for a <span class="font">J</span> figure,<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
but must be looked for under <span class="font">Ch</span>. In all cases the
degree or direction of slope in the figures, with a few
peculiar exceptions, is of no concern whatever, simplicity
and directness of appeal being aimed at from the first.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">B</span> and <span class="font">P</span>.</p>

<p>These consonants are used to denote a bow. <span class="font">B</span> is
the form of a simple bow with one lineation, or if two
or more lineations blend into one, they are found on the
<i>left</i> side when the convexity of the curve is upwards.
<span class="font">P</span> is such a bow, but strengthened, as it were, by one or
more blended lineations on the <i>right</i> side, with the same
position of the curve. A single line bow is never
represented by <span class="font">P</span>. If a bow with a plurality of blended
lineations is inverted the reading is not at all affected.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">T</span> and <span class="font">D</span></p>

<p>represent pear-shaped, or battledore-like figures. <span class="font">T</span>
denotes such a figure free from attachment to environing
lineations, while <span class="font">D</span> stands for a similar figure fixed by its
stem. Reverse the position of the figure or turn it
upside down and its index quality is not affected.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">K</span> and <span class="font">G</span></p>

<p>represent spindle-like forms, like the above but with
<i>two</i> (opposite) stems instead of one. When the figure is
moored by one stem it is denoted by <span class="font">K</span>; when fixed at
both ends or free at both, by <span class="font">G</span>. Position does not
affect these figures.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">V</span> and <span class="font">W</span>.</p>

<p>These letters stand for whorls or spirals, a kind of
figure that often presents much difficulty in finger-print
classification. <span class="font">W</span> is a whorl in which, tracing its course
from the centre outwards, the pen goes round as a clock-hand
turns, or as one looking towards the south<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
perceives the sun to cross the sky. <span class="font">V</span>, on the other
hand, is one which, traced in the same way (from
within outwards), the pen goes like the clock-hand
backwards, or <i>widdershins</i>. Alteration in position makes
no practical difference whatever in the reading of those
figures into their proper syllables for an index.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">O</span> and <span class="font"><a id="Q"></a>Q</span></p>

<p>Although <span class="font">O</span> is a vowel and will be met with again under
that class, it is paired in a kind of way with <span class="font">Q</span>.</p>

<p><span class="font">O</span> denotes a <i>small</i> circle or oval, or opaque, round,
or ovoid dot, <i>contained in the core of a pattern</i>.</p>

<p><span class="font">Q</span> denotes a <i>large</i> circle or oval, containing, usually
within itself, other pattern elements of small dimensions.</p>

<p>A circle or ovoid is called <i>large</i> when it occupies a
space wider than two average lineations of that finger-pattern
in which it occurs. If any doubt exists, by the
principle previously mentioned, the figure is referred to
<span class="font">O</span> as prior to <span class="font">Q</span> in alphabetical sequence.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">M</span> and <span class="font">N</span></p>

<p>denote figures somewhat resembling mountain peaks,
<span class="font">M</span> signifying an outline like that of a typical volcanic
peak, while <span class="font">N</span>, though similar, ends in a rod-like form,
as of a flag-staff on a mountain top. Invert either of
those typical forms and they can be read as before.</p>

<p>A curved cliff-like form, like a wave with a curling
crest, may be indicated by the Spanish ñ.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">L</span> and <span class="font">R</span></p>

<p>denote loops in which curvatures are apt to occur. <span class="font">L</span> is
a loop, the axis of which is straight, while <span class="font">R</span> is one the
axis of which is curved or crooked.</p>

<p>Note that if the legs of a loop widen out beyond the
parallels, it is no longer a loop, but a bow or a mountain.<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
They may narrow again and yet remain loops till at last
they coalesce, when the figure is transformed into a
spindle or a battledore (<span class="font">T</span>, <span class="font">D</span>; <i>or</i> <span class="font">K</span>, <span class="font">G</span>). If the bend is
more than that of a right angle, it comes under a new
definition, and has some qualities of the whorl or spiral,
but is more complex. This need not be entered upon
here.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">S</span> and <span class="font">Z</span></p>

<p>I have used these two consonants to indicate certain
patterns of a sinuous, undulating, or zig-zag type, the
sinuous or purely undulating figures coming under <span class="font">S</span>,
but under <span class="font">Z</span> if there is at least one distinct angularity
in the pattern.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">X</span></p>

<p>This letter, long familiar to the student of algebra as
the symbol of the undetermined, I have reserved for the
inclusion of various nondescript and anomalous patterns.
Those might become fairly numerous in an extensive
register, and in such case there would, no doubt, be
found a good basis for fresh sub-classification.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">F</span> and <span class="font">H</span></p>

<p>These two aspirates are made to do useful service, not
unlike that of vowels, but not of sufficient interest to be
noted in a work like this.</p>

<p>We have thus, with the use of consonants alone, built
up a kind of osseous or skeletal system, and we have
now but to add the vowels to make those dry bones
speak. Let us now consider this element in the syllabic
method.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">A</span></p>

<p>This vowel indicates that the interior of a given loop,
whorl, circle, or containing pattern of any kind, is empty<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
or vacant. Dealing here only with the simpler conditions
in which combinations of vowels and consonants
are found, such a figure will be indexed as <i>Ra, La, Ta,
Da</i>, as the dominant consonant may require. Such combinations
as <i>ar, al, at, ad</i>, etc., may occur, but this would
lead us into too many intricate ramifications for a work
like the present.</p>

<p>If a pattern is very simple&mdash;consisting, for example,
of almost parallel lines&mdash;it may be denoted by the letter
<span class="font">A</span> alone. There are such patterns, and they seem to be
somewhat commoner among certain of the negro tribes.
I have mentioned in a previous chapter such a pattern
on the toe of a lady, and they are typical almost in some
monkeys.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">E</span></p>

<p>When we find in the interior of some loop, bow, or
other pattern, a group of not less than three short detached
lines, or dots, this is to be indicated by the use of
<span class="font">E</span> with the ruling consonant, as <i>te, re, me</i>, and so on.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">I</span></p>

<p>stands for a simple detached line, or not more than
two parallel lines, in the heart of an encircling pattern.</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">O</span></p>

<p>stands for a little oval or circle, or for a round or oval-shaped
dot in a core. If the circle, oval, etc. is <i>large</i>,
extending over a width occupied by two lineations, then
it is treated as a consonantal form. [See also <span class="font"><a href="#Q">Q</a></span>.]</p>


<p class="tac"><span class="font">U</span></p>

<p>indicates a fork with two or more prongs within a core,
forking towards the bend of bow, loop, mountain, etc.
A single prong or spur standing out like a twig is to be
distinguished from a fork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>

<p class="tac"><span class="font">Y</span></p>

<p>is for a similar fork as described above, but turning its
two or more prongs away from the concavity of its enclosing
loop, bow, etc.</p>

<p>Besides the direct combination of simple vowels and
consonants, which arrangement by itself gives great
variety to the index registers, an immense number of
syllables are formed by combinations of two or more
consonants, while some few of the vowels are treated as
long or short where the pattern needs further discrimination;
as, for <span class="nowrap">example:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="tac"><i>bra</i>, <i>spo</i>, <i>art</i>, <i>prīd</i>, <i>prĭd</i>, <i>nut</i>, <i>nūt</i>.</p>

<p>By this method the most extensive register is gripped
<i>and needs no other index than its own essential structure</i>.
If the sheets or cards are kept in their proper sequence,
and it would require to be the duty of some one&mdash;not
necessarily an expert&mdash;to see that the alphabetic syllables
were kept in serial order, there should be no difficulty in
finding the document sought for, if it is there at all.</p>

<p>In translating fresh finger-prints into syllabic form,
one has to catch the ideal design, so to speak, in the
pattern. The consonantal skeleton, in one of its duplicate
forms, is then examined for its containing vowel,
and the syllable is complete. The work can be done with
amazing rapidity after one is familiar with the patterns,
which soon appeal direct to the eye as the type does in a
printed book.</p>

<p>Let us now look at a few examples tabulated to show
how the system works in detail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>PRACTICAL RESULTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF
DACTYLOGRAPHY</h3>


<p>Till quite recently the method of identifying prisoners
was that of personal recognition, often very admirably
carried out. One may readily conceive that a criminal
officer, a Bow Street runner of the old school, or a
modern detective, might acquire great acuteness in
perceiving points of individual character in face, form,
gait, speech, and manner; and during the period of
arrest, trial, and imprisonment there were many opportunities
of observing notable offenders. Nor is such a
power to be despised at the present time. How helpful
a little point might even be under skilful disguise occurred
to my own mind in this way. When I saw the great
Henry Irving in the part of Mephistopheles in “Faust,”
a certain slight stiffness in the calves was assumed, by
me, to be a very clever and subtle suggestion of the
cloven hoofs which were supposed to aid the movements
of that mediaeval personage. But the great actor
walked other totally different parts in the same way,
so that on the street, in any disguise, the notice of an
acute detective might have been arrested. I am shortsighted,
but can often recognize people at a distance
too great to distinguish features, by some peculiarity
of gait or gesture. In Taylor’s <i>Manual of Medical
Jurisprudence</i> [ed. of 1891, pp. 317, 318], there is a<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
curious and interesting example of how recognition
sometimes failed. The story is thus <span class="nowrap">told:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A trial took place at the Old Bailey in 1834, in
which a man was wrongly charged with being a convict,
and with having unlawfully returned from transportation.
The chief clerk of Bow Street produced a
certificate, dated in 1817, of the conviction of a person,
alleged to be the prisoner, under the name of Stuart.
The governor of the gaol in which Stuart was confined
believed the prisoner to be the person who was
then in his custody. The guard of the hulks to which
Stuart was consigned from the gaol swore most positively
that the prisoner was the man. On the cross-examination
of this witness, he admitted that the
prisoner Stuart, who was in his custody in 1817, had
a wen on his left hand; and so well-marked was this
that it formed part of his description in the books of
the convict-hulk. The prisoner said his name was
<i>Stipler</i>: he denied that he was the person named
Stuart, but from the lapse of years he was unable to
bring forward any evidence. The Recorder was proceeding
to charge the jury, when the counsel for the
defence requested to be permitted to put a question
to an eminent surgeon, Carpue, who happened,
accidentally, to be present in court. He deposed
that it was impossible to <i>remove such a wen as had
been described, without leaving a mark or cicatrix</i>.
Both hands of the prisoner were examined, but no
wen, nor any mark of a wen having been removed,
was found. Upon this the jury acquitted the prisoner.”</p></div>

<p>Charles Dickens, aided by the pencil of “Phiz,” in
<i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, gives us the power of seeing the
process of “portrait taking,” which was simply done by
a group of runners and warders staring hard at the
prisoner and noting his points.</p>

<p>In a Blue Book, <i>Identification of Habitual Criminals</i>,
published in 1892, which contains the report of a<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
Committee appointed by Mr. Asquith, who was then Home
Secretary, we read <span class="nowrap">that:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The practice of the English police, though the
details differ widely in different forces, is always dependent
on personal recognition by police or prison
officers. This is the means by which identity is
<i>proved</i> in criminal courts; and, though its scope is
extended by photography, and it is in some cases
aided by such devices as the registers of distinctive
marks, it also remains universally the basis of the
methods by which identity is <i>discovered</i>.”</p></div>

<p><i>The Register of Distinctive Marks</i>, such as the wen
in the case just mentioned, contained under nine divisions
of the body those permanent scars from wounds,
operations or burns, tattoo marks, moles, wens, warts,
mother marks, etc., which might be expected to prove
helpful in identification. Those registers were published
annually, and distributed to all the different forces
throughout the country. The system does not seem to
have been very successful. For example, out of sixty-one
enquiries, in twenty cases no information was obtained.
As to the remaining forty-one cases, eight were
incorrect, while of ten cases no ultimate intelligence
reached the Registrar. The conclusion of the Committee
is thus stated (p.&nbsp;8)<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It appears to us, therefore, that the comparative
failure of these registers is due, not to any want of
care in the way in which the work has been done, nor
to the mode of classification, but rather to the inherent
difficulty of devising any exhaustive classification of
criminals on the basis of bodily marks alone, and also
to the difficulty of using a register of criminals that
is published at intervals and in a printed form.”</p></div>

<p>Four years before this, as I have stated, I submitted
to Inspector Tunbridge, deputed from Scotland Yard
to meet me, an “exhaustive classification of criminals<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
on the basis of bodily marks alone,” but the chairman
of that Committee, now Sir Charles E. Troup, told me
himself, at the Home Office, that he had never heard
anything of it. It is now, however, in use pretty well
throughout the civilized world.</p>

<p>Some progress, nevertheless, was made. A card index
was recommended, and greater definiteness in the
description of the bodily marks was to be observed.
A very notable change was also foreshadowed in the
whole conception of the subject.</p>

<p>It is interesting now to read that “it was strongly
represented to us by Chief-Inspector Neame and his
officers, that there should be greater precision in the
taking of descriptive marks, and that their distance
from fixed points in the body should be measured and
recorded.” Science is measurement, and it is highly
creditable to the English police that this demand was
now to come from them.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of the Register Form as applying
to the Right Arm&mdash;one of the nine divisions of the body
for this purpose.</p>

</table></div>

<p>A “scar on the forehead” was so common a mark
of the criminal class, that, unlike the brand of Cain, it
had no distinguishing value. One curious point, which<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
has surely escaped the notice of writers of detective
stories, was that in Liverpool “special registers are kept
of the maiden names of the wives and mothers of criminals,
as it is found that in a large proportion of cases
an offender, when he changes his name, takes either his
wife’s or his mother’s.” It is curious that, in France,
a criminal more readily gives his own name correctly
than in this country, but the trustworthiness of the
finger-print records is now slowly working to a similar
frame of mind among English recidivists. Photographs
had been taken, as they are now to some extent, and
they are, indeed, often most useful. Certain “routes”
were arranged, and the forms and photographs were
sent round the circuit of police stations, so as to be
returned within the usual week of remand. Remarks
on these forms were not used as evidence, but were used
for official guidance only. The word “photograph”
seems now (1912) to comprehend the taking of finger-prints
in the official method with ordinary printer’s ink.</p>

<p>With all the precautions then available, it was found
that mistakes in identification involved unjust suffering.
A man named Coyle was sentenced for larceny in 1889,
a Millbank warder swearing to his previous conviction,
ten years before, as one Hart. The jury having examined
Hart’s photograph gave a hostile verdict, the
distinctive marks of the two men were found to be
different, and Coyle moreover showed that he had been
doing a short term when Hart was in prison. As is
wisely stated in p.&nbsp;23 of the Report: “The true test of
the efficiency of a system of identification is not the
number of identifications made, but the number of mis-identifications,
or of failure to identify.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span></p>

<p>A woman lacking her left breast was identified with
another who had suffered in the same way, and who had
been previously convicted. It became clear that the
women were different, and poor <span class="nowrap">Eliza &mdash;&mdash;</span> had her
punishment accordingly reduced from seven years’ penal
servitude to six months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>A case in 1908 was that of two men charged with
burglary, both of whom were short of a fore-finger,
and were about the same age and of similar
appearance.</p>

<p>A man named Blake was found under circumstances
that suggested an attempt at burglary, and was identified
by a constable and several others, including a prison
warder, as a convict called Steed, under supervision.
It was found, however, that Blake had clearly been at
liberty when Steed was in prison, and the former was
promptly acquitted.</p>

<p>One Callan was convicted as an incorrigible rogue,
but had been identified wrongly with another man,
he himself at the time of the alleged offence certainly
having been in St. George’s Workhouse. He was,
however, afterwards rightly convicted for a similar
offence. It would appear from these and numerous
other cases not referred to in this Report, that those
mistakes affect only the criminal class. Probably there
is a little too much readiness to identify a known rogue
with the offender wanted, and those unfortunate
victims often of disease and early training deserve fair
and just dealing. Alas, however, the really innocent
have sometimes suffered dreadfully from judicial
blunders. The famous Beck case is too recent and tragic
to require recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span></p>

<p>But, besides occasional false identifications of innocent
persons, the old system, now happily superseded,
was admittedly very ineffective in detecting old offenders
passing under different disguises and with false names.
The time spent on each identification of old offenders
was very great, an average of eight hours being required
for one identification. A few minutes is now found to be
sufficient.</p>

<p>Tattoo marks are not always so small or so restricted
in character as they are found to be by the English
police. In <i>Knowledge</i> of April, 1911, I had printed in
colours a wonderful reproduction of a painting made for
me in Japan, of a servant of mine, whose body was finely
tattooed over its whole surface, barring face, hands, and
feet, in different colours. It had cost him many years’
suffering and a small fortune in money to achieve, but
he was rather proud of it. I have seen many such
examples, though few so fine as a work of art. Extensive
tattooing is also common among Italian criminals, the
whole body being adorned.</p>

<p>Simple tattoo marks cannot be entirely effaced, but
may be defaced; a simple design being made more
complicated or altered so as to mislead entirely. A
Leeds warder said in evidence before Mr. Asquith’s
Committee, that: “Tattoo marks are sometimes defaced.
I know one case where a person had a letter <span class="font">D</span>
on left breast; it is now made into ‘Mermaid.’ This
is sometimes done to prevent recognition in prison.
Sometimes the tattoo is removed, but a flesh mark of
same shape left.”</p>

<p>Our Home Office was indisposed to move hastily in
such a matter as finger-print evidence of identity<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
suggested by Englishmen. Another system, very excellent
in its way, had the immense advantage of being
of foreign origin. As the result, however, of several
years’ experience, some inherent defects in Mons.
Bertillon’s anthropometric system&mdash;adopted in a modified
form by our authorities in 1894&mdash;were brought into
notice. It was found to be rather delicate for every-day
practice, and the fine measurements taken officially
often varied. In 1901 therefore, a fresh Committee,
with Lord Belper as chairman, was appointed, but no
report seems ever to have been published. Soon afterwards,
in July, 1902, the Home Secretary directed the
introduction of a system of identification based upon
finger-prints only, in supersession of the French method
of identifying by bodily measurements in a certain order.
The results soon showed that the tardy decision had been
immediately justified. There was greater certainty
assured of valid identifications, the labour was much
less, the expense was diminished, and a great danger of
false identification was effectively removed.</p>

<p>That the system had taken root was soon evidenced
by many newspaper paragraphs of subsequent date.
Here is a bit of every-day evidence from a criminal
case which resulted in conviction. It appeared in the
columns of the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, as far back as December
2nd, 1903. Many such cases were never reported at
all. The witness, we are told, had “not the slightest
shadow of a doubt that the finger-prints of Elliott were
identical with those in the records of Scotland Yard.
He might be considered an expert in the matter of finger-prints.
Altogether he had dealt with about 500,000
cases of finger-prints.” To this report may be added a<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
sentence from that of <i>The Times</i>, of the same date:
“He had never known the finger-prints of different
persons to agree.” The witness is significantly described
as Detective-Sergeant Collins, of the Finger-Print Office,
Scotland Yard. At a later date the same witness
(now Inspector Collins), bearing evidence as to the
Houndsditch murders, stated that they had now 170,000
different sets of prints recorded. He added that,
“During the last ten years, since the introduction of
the system in 1901, they had made upwards of 62,000
identifications and recognitions, and, so far as he knew,
without error. They dealt, therefore, with pretty large
numbers, and he was justified in saying that he had never
found two impressions of different fingers to agree.”
[<i>The Daily Mail</i>, February 25th, 1911.]</p>

<p>In <i>The Daily Mail</i> of August 10th, 1910, Inspector
Munro, of the Finger-print Department of Scotland Yard,
in giving evidence that an imprint on a broken window
was that of the accused’s right middle finger, added:
“There had never been any mistake yet in finger-print
identification.”</p>

<p>One Cris Keegan, who received five years’ penal
servitude at Dublin in June, 1910, had left a finger-print
on a broken church window at Rathmichael.
His counsel, pleading guilty for him, said: [<i>The Daily
Mail</i>, June 10th, 1910] “That when, before the magistrates
the accused supplied the best testimony to the
finger-print system which it had yet received, by saying
‘The taking of these finger-prints is the greatest invention
for the detection of criminals. I throw myself on
the mercy of the court. I did visit the church.’&#8239;”
This poor man had been convicted forty times before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. William Henry, a witness in the case, who was in
charge of the register for criminals in Dublin castle, said,
“he had put through his hands about 150,000 finger-prints,
and no two had ever been found alike. This
system of identification had now superseded all other
methods, and he regarded it as infallible.” Witness,
having examined the prisoner’s fingers in the dock, then
said, “the finger-print on the glass had been made by
the prisoner’s right fore-finger.”</p>

<p>Criminals, dreading this kind of evidence, have of
late taken sometimes to destroying their ridge-patterns
on the fingers. They sometimes also remove and
clean a window-pane which they have touched. In
the early part of the fourteenth century, clerks in
holy orders claimed what was called “benefit of
clergy,” that is, the privilege of being tried for certain
crimes by ecclesiastical courts only, a privilege which
was afterwards extended to all persons who could
read&mdash;for reading was a somewhat rare accomplishment
in those merry old times. In 1487 this benefit was restricted,
so that a mere layman who was able to read
could secure it only once, and then he was to be <i>branded
on the thumb</i>, to show that he had already enjoyed his
one opportunity, thus carefully obliterating by legal
methods the best means of proving the fact.</p>

<p>A Leeds man, charged with burglary, was stated in
<i>The Daily Mail</i> of April 14th, 1908, to have destroyed
every one of his finger-ends so that his prints could not
be taken. He had been convicted several times before,
and had been sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>The complete burglar’s outfit now includes well-fitting
gloves as an essential element, quite as important<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
as skeleton keys and regulation jemmies. This fact is
curiously applied by the late John Davidson, who says,
in <i>Mammon and His Message</i>: “The gloves of party,
of culture, of creed, wherewith men hide their finger-prints
lest they should be caught in the act of being
themselves, I decline to wear.”</p>

<p>Early in 1904, an office in Bradford was broken
into by smashing a glass panel in the door. Some
cash and postage stamps were secured by the
robber. On one piece of glass a single finger-mark
had been imprinted accidentally, which was found
by the police to be that of a suspected person
whose impressions had been officially secured some time
before. The offender was duly charged with the crime
and convicted. The photographs in this case were
reproduced in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> of May, 1905, one
being the enlarged impression found on the piece of
glass, and the other that of the supposed corresponding
impression, which was that of the prisoner’s left thumb.
Those finger-prints resemble, but their mutual likeness
is by no means quite conclusive and convincing. Mr.
Mallet, the author of the “Finger-Prints which have
Convicted Criminals,” however, says: “The reader will
see how precisely similar are the impressions, and he will
be interested, with the aid of a microscope, in seeing how
exactly the almost countless ridges and characteristics
of the thumb are faithful doubles.” The patterns are
both enlarged so greatly that not even a lens is required
for their discernment, and the “countless ridges” do
not run above forty. The two figures are not equalized
in their enlargement and comparison is made unnecessarily
difficult, but when made, the curves for some reason<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
cannot be got to agree. The officially registered impression
affords clear lineations, but that on the bit of
glass panel is muddled and smudgy. On the whole I
should not call it a good example of this kind of identification.</p>

<p>A second case given is that of an imprint on a small
box which had been used for containing homœopathic
remedies. Some cash had been stolen on a certain
Saturday night, and on Friday the delinquent was captured
and convicted by means of his finger-prints.</p>

<p>The reproduced photographs show the pattern to be
somewhat simple, and, allowing for a certain inevitable
faintness due to indirect reproduction, the evidence is
good of its kind. A pattern of somewhat greater
complexity would have afforded much stronger evidence.
The chances of a single finger-print of very simple design,
so to say, being repeated in the case of another person,
is not to be ignored, and if the suspected smudge is
obscure the evidence ceases to be of much value.</p>

<p>Of the third case mentioned, we are assured that
“without the finger-print it would have been impossible
to convict.” Now, the enlarged imprint of the suspect’s
right middle finger has been printed quite clearly, and
has good, unique characteristics, but just where these
would be most useful for identification the lines in the
suspected smudge are fatally blurred and useless for
comparison.</p>

<p>A better case is that of a print on a drinking-glass,
which was brought out in the way dealt with in a previous
chapter of this work. The pattern was rather striking,
and the resemblance convincing. The prisoner after<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>wards
confessed his guilt and assisted the police to arrest
another man and to recover some stolen property.</p>

<p>In an old French reading book I learned from in
earlier days, there was a story of a country doctor who
in visiting an upland farmer’s wife could find no paper
or ink for his prescription. So he wrote his orders in
chalk on the farm door and told them to take that to
the chemist. They took the door. It seems that a
chief detective of Bradford found a bath-room door
imprinted in circumstances that aroused suspicion.
Protected carefully by paper the door was conveyed on a
cart to the Town Hall, as evidence in the case.</p>

<p>Identification does not merely ensure the conviction
of the guilty. A very pleasing example was sent to me
by an eminent American author and journalist, which
shows how the legal use of finger-print evidence established
the innocence of an accused negro. Briefly, the
story was this. A murder had been committed in Kansas
by a coloured man named William West. While looking
for him it turned out that the police had just placed under
arrest for some minor offence, a young negro named
William West, who, however, stoutly maintained his
innocence of the murder. The French method of bodily
measurements was applied, and the person under arrest
was found to correspond exactly in his dimensions in
trunk and limbs with those of the sought-for murderer.
It remained now only to take the imprints of his finger-tips,
a method not long before introduced in that State.
It was then clearly seen that, by their decided divergences
in pattern, the man in custody could not be the guilty
person, although name, colour, and measurements all
agreed in the two men. A few days later the real<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
murderer was arrested. The report sent by my friend
concludes thus: “The coincidences of name and figure
might have been fatal to the innocent man, if the impression
of the finger-tips had not also been employed as
a means of identification. The police say that this test
is infallible. The impression of one man’s finger-tips
never corresponds exactly with those of any other
man.”</p>

<p>The system is now largely used in many of the States.
Mr. W.&nbsp;A. Pinkerton, the well-known Sherlock Holmes
of America, has a high opinion of the validity of the
method, and wrote me on his recent visit to this country
that he intended to study the subject more closely.</p>

<p>A curious incident happened many years ago to a
doctor in the district where I live. Returning from a
visit at a late hour, by a lonely road, he was suddenly
assailed by a powerful ruffian who tried to garrot him.
The doctor, a notably athletic man, objecting to the
treatment, finally got one of his assailant’s fingers into
his mouth and amputated it neatly with his teeth. Early
in the morning the rogue came to the same doctor’s
surgery unwittingly, seeking for surgical help, was seized,
and ultimately convicted, getting heavy punishment.
Now, on telling this true story (the finger is still kept in
spirit) to Mr.&mdash;now Sir Charles E.&mdash;Troup, at the Home
Office, that gentleman smilingly said such a case would
never by any chance occur again. Well, in October,
1909, a constable patrolling St. John’s Street, Clerkenwell,
found, sticking on a spike at the top of a gate, a
bloody finger with a ring on it. This was promptly
submitted to the police experts at Scotland Yard, who
were convinced that it had belonged to a man known<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
as “William Mitchell.” A man called “May,” with his
hand bleeding and bandaged up had just been arrested.
It was then found that he had just lost a finger, which he
admitted had been done when he was hurriedly getting
over the gate. He got twelve months’ hard labour, as
consolation.</p>

<p>Many years ago I endeavoured to show the value of
this method in the recognition of the dead, where records
existed. The importance it might acquire is illustrated
by the case of a man killed on the Great Western Railway
at Slough. His body had been badly shattered and
mutilated, and nothing was found in the poor man’s
pockets but a match-box and a tobacco pipe. Superintendent
Pearman sent the finger-prints of the dead man
to Scotland Yard, where it was established beyond any
doubt that the deceased was one Walter James Downes,
a farrier, of Deal. How he came to be known at Scotland
Yard is not stated in the newspaper report. The record
of a blameless life would have permitted him to rest in
a nameless grave.</p>

<p>In some parts of the Continent means are used
systematically to identify, by their finger-prints, all
vagrants and tramps. It would seem to be clear that in
this country a large proportion of those poor waifs are
not really criminals in disposition, being often merely
failures from physical or mental incapacity, persons
hopelessly inefficient in performing the simplest tasks of
an industrial life. Among those there is ever a floating
population of professional criminals, and others again
who are not chronic evildoers, but have, perhaps, once
been guilty of some grave offence which has separated
them from home and friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span></p>

<p>The Chief Constable of Halifax, in his annual report
(1909) deplores the absence of any means of discriminating
between the “honest hard-up” and the habitual
tramps, who are often rogues and vagabonds. He
advocates a central registry for the United Kingdom,
based on the finger-print method. This, he thought,
would reduce the number of beggars, and would give the
genuine but unfortunate worker indisputable evidence
as to the purity of his record, and entitle him to more
generous treatment in his search of work.</p>

<p>Amongst other evidences that the English method has
come to stay, one might quote the prospectus of the
Birmingham University Medical Course (1911). There
we are informed that the course of Forensic Medicine
(Professor Morrison) now includes “Finger-prints and
Foot-marks.”</p>

<p>In Stoke-on-Trent, the method of finger-prints is
reported to have saved the borough both time and money,
as compared with the old photographic method. The
Chief Constable reported that in Hanley, in 1908 (now
incorporated with Stoke): “The finger impressions of
seven prisoners, whose antecedents were unknown, were
taken by the police, and forwarded to the Registrar of
Habitual Criminals, and in six of the cases the impressions
were identified as those of persons previously convicted
of crime.” As had been done in a previous report, it
is also stated, that “a considerable amount is annually
saved to the department by the discontinuance of the
photographing of prisoners, excepting where special
circumstances make it desirable or necessary.”</p>

<p>According to the <i>Evening Post</i>, the leading financial
journal of New York, the new system of finger-prints is<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
rapidly growing in favour with bankers who have been
recently victimised by swindlers and forgers. The
Williamsburg Savings Bank was the first institution to
adopt the system. Other banks, finding it entailed
much delay, appointed a special clerk, whose duty it is
to persuade ladies to remove their gloves and submit to
the inking operation.</p>

<p>A New York lawyer, Mr. F.&nbsp;R. Fast, advocated some
years ago a finger-print method of attesting legal
documents, as by the old-fashioned seal now disused,
except in a few high official cases. His suggestion was
that a man should choose one of his ten fingers, the one
which happens to have most individuality about it,
perhaps, as his “Ego” finger, with which to adhibit
his impression after his usual written signature, in law
papers, cheques, and the like. He also advocated
storing past (in regard to wills, etc.) impressions of all
the ten fingers. This has always been my contention,
that the ten fingers should be used in cases requiring
great security. One or more should also be adhibited
in the case of illiterate persons who now sign with a
cross. With passports, this is now actually done in
several countries on the European continent. It ought
at once, I think, to be adopted by bankers, for circular
notes&mdash;a great convenience to travellers having to use
different currencies, but who may sometimes find it
difficult to get a friend to identify them. The case of
pensioners, old age and others, would seem to be urgent
now, and, as a medical man, I cannot help thinking
that present official methods are rather loose and may
lead to frequent abuses. A general practitioner is asked
to sign a certificate of identity in circumstances where<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
it is not easy to be certain. A good-natured, busy doctor
may aid roguery by simply echoing what an applicant,
or his friends, may have suggested.</p>

<p>In criminal trials, an English jury ought to be afforded
some safeguard as to identity. A supposed old convict
who had become a constable fell again into evil ways,
but was soon found out by a comparison of fresh finger-prints,
with records which he had not at first been suspected
of having left behind. He had had a good
character in the army. The jury in this case very
properly insisted on being thoroughly satisfied by their
own examination of the finger-print evidence submitted
to the court. Not all juries are quite complaisant
on this point. I was present at a case in which very
pertinent and intelligent questions were asked by one
or two sceptical jurymen, and a demonstration of the
printing process done before them was insisted upon.</p>

<p>In one Old Bailey case the jury finally rejected evidence
of this kind. The comment of a London newspaper
was <span class="nowrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In finger-print cases the police expert is generally
trusted implicitly, and the jury is apt to be forgetful
of the fact that, although the theory of finger-prints
has been reduced almost to an exact science, mistakes
may be made in applying it, and the policeman has
frequently an over-anxiety to prove his case that may
distort his view.”</p></div>

<p>The true cure for this evil, which has often been pointed
out, would seem to be the systematic instruction of the
police force&mdash;or some select numbers of them&mdash;in all
such matters as come within their official duties. With
eight years’ experience as a police surgeon, I must say<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
that a great deal of the valuable kind of evidence that
recent fiction has made popular is spoiled by the methods
of the average constable. Professor Glaister, the
eminent medical jurist of Glasgow, was, I think,
the first to give a place to finger-print evidence in a
work on Forensic Medicine. The second edition of his
work is fully illustrated with specimens. We have seen
that the study of finger-and foot-prints now forms a
regular subject in the medical course of Birmingham
University. It would be easy to arrange, at local
centres, such instruction in this method as is now frequently
given to constables in ambulance work. To
some extent this, I believe, has already been done, but
the teachers themselves evidently need to be taught
some elemental principles to instruct effectively. The
huge records left in Scotland Yard and other police
centres of administration have not as yet done any
service to the biological aspects of Dactylography.
They are silent and still as the rocks were before Hutton
and Lyell struck them with the rod of science and made
living springs gush out in great abundance.</p>
